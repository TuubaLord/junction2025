Institutions should set out, in their policies and procedures, the criteria for using advanced statistical models for the purposes of valuation, revaluation and monitoring the values of collateral. These policies and procedures should account for such models' proven track record, property-specific variables considered, the use of minimum available and accurate information, and models' uncertainty.",

Institutions should ensure that the advanced statistical models used are: a. property and location specific at a sufficient level of granularity (e.g. postcode for immovable property collateral); b. valid and accurate, and subject to robust and regular backtesting against the actual observed transaction prices; c. based on a sufficiently large and representative sample, based on observed transaction prices; d. based on up-to-date data of high quality.",

            "121. CSRBB does not include the effect of credit quality changes during the observation period (i.e., rating category downgrade/upgrade of a specific counterparty or instrument, considered as migration risk). In particular, the deterioration of an institution's credit quality should not have any positive impact on the credit spread risk measure. Institutions should avoid any overlap with the credit valuation adjustment risk management framework when assessing the CSRBB.",

Institutions should not exclude any instrument in the banking book from the perimeter of CSRBB ex ante, including assets, liabilities, derivatives and other off-balance sheet items such as loan commitments, irrespective of their accounting treatment. Any potential exclusion of instruments from the relevant perimeter should be done in the case of the absence of sensitivity to credit spread risk and should be appropriately documented and justified. In any case, institutions should not exclude assets accounted at fair value.",

            "21.Based on this, the EBA understands that assets at fair value constitute a category that should always be included in the perimeter of CSRBB. This is in line with the current GL and also has practical evidence. This also provides a minimum harmonisation in the definition of the perimeter.",
            "22.However, the EBA considers that CSRBB exposures should not be confined upfront to these categories only. Indeed, and despite the perimeter in the current EBA GL, banks report other categories as exposed to CSRBB in practice and therefore banks should pay attention to all potential exposures to CSRBB irrespective of the asset or liability category they are. For these reasons the EBA opts for Policy option B for the definition of the perimeter.",
            "23.As regards the definition of CSRBB itself, the EBA considers that idiosyncratic elements should not be included since they are generally covered in other risk framework, mainly the credit risk. Considering these elements in the definition could trigger double counting issues. Also from a conceptual perspective, CSRBB is purely market related and therefore market and liquidity related elements should conform its definition. Nevertheless, after accounting for proportionality aspects and the qualitative QIS input mentioned in the previous item, the GL envisage some flexibility in the treatment of idiosyncratic elements, as long as the results would become more conservative. This is a good balance in the implementation between the pure definition of CSRBB and the operational difficulties that some banks might find in disentangling the idiosyncratic elements of credit spread risk. 62 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF INTEREST RATE RISK AND CREDIT SPREAD RISK ARISING FROM NON- TRADING BOOK ACTIVITIES"

Interest rate risks in trading book positions should be considered by institutions as a component of market risk.",

Institutions should conduct stress tests for their positions in financial instruments in trading and fair value reported in other comprehensive income (FVOCI) portfolios (i.e. accounting terms to classify financial assets), including securitisation instruments/positions and covered bonds. These stress tests should be undertaken as part of institution-wide stress testing as well as for market risk management and calculation purposes.",

Institutions should apply a range of severe but plausible scenarios for all positions referred to in the previous paragraph, e.g. exceptional changes in market prices, shortages of liquidity in the markets and the defaulting of large market participants. Dependencies and correlations between different markets and, consequently, adverse changes in correlations should, where appropriate, also be taken into account and factored in. The impact on accounting credit value adjustment (CVA) and on reserves related to institutions' portfolios (e.g. reserves for liquidity, for modelling uncertainties) should be taken into account equally in stress tests. Market risk reserve stress testing should be substantiated. 37 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INSTITUTIONS' STRESS TESTING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY",

When calibrating these stress tests, institutions should take into account at least the nature and characteristics of their portfolios and related financial instruments (e.g. vanilla/exotic products, liquidity, maturity), their trading strategies, and the possibility of, associated cost of and potential time involved in hedging out or managing risks under severe market conditions.",

Institutions should develop an appropriate approach to capturing the underestimation of tail risk by historical data (fat tails) where applicable, e.g. by applying severe hypothetical scenarios, and, where risk is assessed against percentile confidence levels, should consider tail events beyond those confidence levels.",
            "131. Institutions should in particular: a) assess the consequences of major market disturbances and identify plausible situations that could entail extraordinarily high losses, which should, where appropriate, also include events with a low probability for all main risk types, especially the various components of market risks; for portfolio level stress tests, the effects of adverse changes to correlations might be explored; and mitigating effects of management actions may be taken into account if they are based on plausible assumptions about market liquidity; and b) have in place a list of the measures containing limits and other possible actions taken to reduce risks and preserve own funds; in particular, limits on exchange rate, interest rate, equity price and commodity price risks set by institutions should, where appropriate, be taken into account against the results of the stress testing calculations."
