                "(1) Outsourcing is a way of arranging supervised entities' activities, covered by financial market regulation. By outsourcing, supervised entities may seek to increase the efficiency, flexibility and competitiveness of their operations. However, responsibility for outsourced activities remains with the supervised entity, and therefore supervised entities' internal control and risk management must also extend to outsourced activities. Supervised entities must send the FIN- FSA an advance notification of intentions to outsource material activities.",
                "(2) These regulations aim at ensuring that outsourcing does not in any way impair the criteria for the supervised entity's authorisation and that the supervised entity's operations, also with respect to the outsourced activities, have been arranged so that they are in compliance with all obligations laid down in legal requirements and FIN-FSA regulations and guidelines for internal control and risk management.",
                "(3) The purpose is also to ensure that outsourcing does not impair the possibilities of the supervised entity's management to direct and monitor activities or to obtain an overall picture of the supervised entity's risks. Supervised entities must be able to and capable of managing risks, irrespective of outsourcing.",
                "(4) Furthermore, the purpose is to ensure that, in using outsourced information technology resources via so-called cloud services1, supervised entities ensure in particular that the risks involved with the services are managed, the continuity of the services is secured and that data protection is assured. (Issued on 4.11.2014, valid from 1.1.2015)",
                "(5) These regulations and guidelines are designed to ensure that outsourcing does not impair FIN- FSA supervision and inspection of supervised entities' activities."
