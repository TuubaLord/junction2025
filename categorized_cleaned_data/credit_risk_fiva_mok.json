The area aR is approximated by first forming a bar between each 5% bucket, where the width of the horizontal axis represents the relative proportion of each bucket (here: 5%). The height of the bar indicates the average share of bad credits in these two buckets. For example, the width of the bar between the 5% and 10% score buckets is 5, and its height, on a rounded basis, is 14+26.5 = 20,2 (see Table 1 column \"Cumulative share of bad credits between groups on average, %\"). 2",

            "(15) As regards the supervised entity, a deficiency guarantee granted by a sovereign state, an insurance company or other credit institution increases the current value of the collateral against impairment, but it does not generally increase the current value of the collateral in the context of the LTV calculation. For example, in a situation where the current value of an object is 100, loan amount 90, and the amount to which deficiency guarantee covers the loan is 90, the value of the deficiency guarantee used in LTV calculation is max(0; 90 - 100) = 0.

Short-term refers to a loan period (maturity) of less than 1 year. In addition, the supervised entity must have an estimate of the final situation, ie the LTV after the sale of the previous residence, which must be within the limits for maximum LTV ratio. (Issued on 18.8.2017, valid from 1.10.2017)",

            "(21) It is also possible to deviate from the limits when additional financing is used to prevent or rectify a material decrease in the value of the collateral. Examples of such circumstances include unexpected damages, such as humidity damages, latent structural deficiencies etc. The decrease in the value of the collateral must be sudden and surprising, additional financing cannot be used to compensate for a decrease in collateral values due to a decline in the price level. (Issued on 6.6.2017, valid from 1.10.2017)",
            "(22) The maximum loan-to-value ratio for loans referred to in the Act on bonus for home savers (1634/1992) is the percentage share of the value of the residence, up to which a loan under said Act may be granted. In order to contain the exceptional growth of risk to financial stability, FIN- FSA may decide to limit the maximum amount of lending under the Act by up to 10 percentage points ie to 85% in the case of first-home buyers. However, the loan amount for a residence purchased under the ASP scheme may, even in this case, equal the proportion of purchase price calculated according to the required savings under the law.",
            "(23) A supervised entity may deviate from the maximum LTV limits in situations where a borrower's existing loans are combined as a single new loan so that the total loan amount does not increase, as compared to the situation prevailing before the restructuring, but the value of a previously pledged collateral decreases and the borrower does not have access to new supplementary collateral.

The value of the overcollateralisation shall constantly be at least two per cent. If the requirements laid down in Article 129(3)(a)(3) of the EU Capital Requirements Regulation are not met, the overcollateralisation value shall be at minimum five per cent. In addition to the part laid down in this subsection, the overcollateralisation shall also cover the estimated winding-down costs related to covered bonds. The overcollateralisation amount shall be determined by a calculation method based on present value. When calculating the present value, payments of loan receivables included in the cover pool shall be taken into account in the proportion in which these loan receivables are included in the calculation of the cover pool total value as referred to in section 23 above. If the calculation method based on present value produces a higher cover pool total value than the method based on the nominal value of obligations incurred from the covered bonds, the overcollateralisation shall be determined on the basis of the nominal value. In calculations based on both the current and the nominal value, any increased credit loss risk of the secured receivable shall be appropriately accounted for, at least in cases where the receivable shall, pursuant to Article 178 of the EU Capital Requirements Regulation, be considered non-performing. In calculations based on the nominal value, the cover assets in the cover pool and the impact of currency derivatives contracts shall be taken into account when determining the obligations incurred from covered bonds. In calculations based on the present value, the value of derivatives contracts shall be determined on the basis of present value at the time of valuation. The same method shall be used to determine both the total value of the cover pool and the obligations incurred from the covered bonds. The Financial Supervisory Authority may issue further regulations on the valuation of derivatives and taking total cash flows into account when calculating cover pool total value. The Financial Supervisory Authority may also issue further regulations on the methods used to calculate and value overcollateralisation. REGULATION (paragraphs 2-3)",
            "(2) In both nominal and present value-based calculation, the same method based on the fair value or book value, where lower than the fair value, shall be applied to the substitution assets referred to in section 18 of the MCBCBA and assets used to cover the liquidity buffer requirement under section 31 of the MCBCBA, which is applied to the determination of the liquidity buffer requirement under section 31 of the MCBCBA.",

This entails that the supervised entity determines the total amount of exposures belonging to retail exposures taking into account Article 123, paragraphs a) and c) of the CRR and subsequently removes from this pool any exposures exceeding 0,2% of the total value of the portfolio and finds out any sectoral or similar exposures related to the portfolio.

            "(208) Guidelines 209-211 apply, in addition to credit and financial institutions, to payment institutions and payment service providers referred to in sections 7 and 7 a of the Payment Institutions Act. GUIDELINE (paragraphs 209-211)",
            "(209) According to the FIN-FSA's interpretation, chapter 3, section 10(1) of the AML Act means that a supervised entity may, based on the assessment of risks related to a correspondent banking relationship, come to the conclusion that enhanced due diligence measures are required in respect of the counterparty even though it is established in the EEA. 42 Example: An indication of elevated risk could be, for example, if the counterparty is located in an EEA member state which is placed on a list maintained by the FATF of countries with strategic deficiencies in their regimes to counter and investigate money laundering and terrorist financing and which have prepared an action plan with the FATF to eliminate these deficiencies43. However, this does not mean that enhanced due diligence measures should be automatically applied to the counterparty.",
            "(210) According to the FIN-FSA's interpretation, if a supervised entity intends to enter into correspondent banking relationships, it shall, as part of the procedures referred to in chapter 2, section 3(2), prepare risk-based approaches to be followed in the correspondent banking relationship to obtain adequate information, including procedures to comply with the enhanced due diligence obligation.",
            "(211) The FIN-FSA recommends that, in correspondent banking relationships with counterparties domiciled within the EEA, the supervised entity, applying a risk-based approach: · obtains adequate information on the counterparty to understand what its business consists of and to ensure that the counterparty has effective procedures to ensure compliance with AML/CFT regulations · assesses the reputation of the counterparty based on publicly available information · assesses the quality of supervision targeted at the supervised entity · carefully identifies the beneficial owners and owners of the counterparty and assesses the risks pertaining to its ownership structure."
