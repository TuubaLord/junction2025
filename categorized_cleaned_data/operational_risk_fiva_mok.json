            "(19) The requirements to plan for contingencies is based on the Emergency Powers Act and contingency planning guidelines issued by the authorities. Contingencies are situations as defined in section 3 of the Emergency Powers Act. Normal continuity arrangements form the basis for contingency planning for emergency conditions.",
            "(20) As a rule, disruptions last longer in emergency conditions than those accounted for in normal continuity plans. In addition, the risks associated with emergency conditions are generally more serious than those prepared for in continuity plans.",
            "(21) The guidelines for contingency planning included here may also be applied to severe disruptions and crises other than the emergency conditions referred to in the Emergency Powers Act. Serious disruptions and crises may, for example, be caused by serious threats to functioning of staff or destruction of a supervised entity's premises or IT environment.",
            "(22) In its decision of 5 December 2013, the Government set general objectives for maintenance readiness. The guidelines for contingency planning issued by the Financial Maintenance Pool in 2009 provide more specific contingency planning objectives and more detailed guidelines for contingency planning. Guideline (paragraphs 23-30)",
            "(23) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities, based on a risk analysis, consider whether central and significant production systems used for creating services and the know-how for guiding, maintaining, handling and technically supporting them should be exclusively or substantially maintained in Finland or whether it is sufficient that they can be returned to Finland according to pre-planned arrangements.",
            "(24) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities provide standby facilities for ensuring interbank payments, clearing, settlement and custody of securities, and payment of pensions and other regular transactions also in situations where critical systems for these functions are not available in or outside of Finland. In addition, supervised entities should ensure the card payment infrastructure and the functioning of card certification in Finland.",
            "(25) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities ensure that the paralysis or damage of a single function in the IT and data communication systems required for creating central services do not paralyse the whole system. Supervised entities should prepare for disruptions in international and national data communications by establishing standby facilities.

            "(26) The FIN-FSA recommends that IT systems and data warehouses required for creating central services be geographically separated into at least two places with different risk profiles. Key data and central functions may be moved within the EU area provided that their lawfulness, security and availability for achieving the service objectives defined in this guideline are ensured.",
            "(27) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities secure the key data required for creating services so that the data essential to the continuity of operations can be recovered, if the actual data processing centres or data therein are destroyed. This type of key data includes at least basic data on customers and customer contracts, for example personal data, and data on customers' asset and liability positions. Recovery of data from separate security backup to generally readable electronic format should be tested.",
            "(28) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities' contingency planning also cover outsourced activities in as far as core functions and services must be maintained during emergency conditions. Contingency planning requirements should be taken into account already when outsourcing contracts are drawn up. Supervised entities subject to contingency planning requirements should evaluate contingency plans drawn up by external suppliers and ensure that they meet prevailing requirements. A supervised entity subject to contingency planning requirements should, for example, test an external supplier's contingency plan in joint trial runs with the supplier.",
            "(29) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities subject to contingency planning requirements ensure that they have adequate resources and capacity to maintain their activities in emergency situations and during severe disruptions. Plans for accessing substitute staff and premises should also be made in advance. Availability of substitute resources should be ensured in advance for situations in which a large part of the supervised entity's staff is absent or part of the entity's main premises, hardware and software have been destroyed, or is not otherwise available, or the entity is prevented from carrying out business over a large geographic area.",
