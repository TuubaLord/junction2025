It should rather be understood as meaning that the control relationship is a grouping requirement due to a very strong form of dependency (control as legal dependency) and thus is a subcategory of the wider form of economic dependency. The overarching indicator is the same in both cases, i.e. a single risk between two or more clients ('domino effect'), regardless of the type of connection the single risk is based on.

('Haircut approach') For the purpose of these guidelines, a 'haircut approach' refers to an approach for the estimation of the impact of the downturn period on realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers in which one or several economic factors as referred to in Regulation (EU) xx/xx [RTS on economic downturn] are direct or transformed input(s) in the LGD model and where for the purpose of this estimation these input(s) are adjusted to reflect the impact of the downturn period under consideration. In particular, where the considered economic factor relates to the downturn period under consideration, the haircut should be based on the most severe observation of this economic factor in accordance with the specification of the severity of an economic downturn laid down in Article 3 of Regulation (EU) xx/xx [RTS on economic downturn].",
            "32. ('Extrapolation Approach') For the purposes of these guidelines, an 'extrapolation approach' refers to the estimation of the impact of the downturn period under consideration on LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers if all of the following conditions are met: (a) where a statistically significant dependency between the realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers, averaged over appropriate periods in time, and the economic factors selected in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation xx/xxx [RTS on economic downturn] which are relevant for the downturn period under consideration, can be established the resulting estimates are based on the extrapolated values of the average realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers to the period reflecting the impact of the downturn period; (b) where no statistically significant dependency as described in paragraph 32(a) can be established for an intermediate parameter or risk driver, institutions may estimate the impact of the downturn period under consideration on an intermediate parameter or risk driver based on observed data from a different period, where all of following three conditions are met: (i) at least those components of economic loss that explain the major share of the total economic loss should be estimated by either a haircut approach in accordance with paragraph 31 or an extrapolation approach in accordance with paragraph 32(a); (ii) the institution has observed data for the intermediate parameter or risk driver for a sufficient period of time which is at least as long as the period referred to in Article 181(1)(j) or Article 181(2), last subparagraph of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013; this period of time should include a period 48 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY where the economic factor(s) underlying the considered downturn period show values representing adverse economic conditions.

            "33. Where institutions have observed data covering the downturn period and reflecting the impact of the respective downturn conditions under consideration on an intermediate parameter or risk driver they should use the observed data in combination with the Haircut or Extrapolation Approach to calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period in accordance with paragraph 30.",

To reflect the lack of sufficient loss data, institutions should quantify a strictly positive Category A MoC in accordance with paragraph 37(a)(xi) of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] for all approaches in this section. In particular, institutions applying an extrapolation approach: (a) as referred to in paragraph 32(a), should quantify the Category A MoC by using an appropriate confidence interval to reflect the uncertainty related to the statistical model used to describe the dependency between the realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers and the relevant economic factors; (b) for an intermediate parameter or risk driver as referred to in paragraph 32(b), should quantify the Category A MoC taking into account the ratio of the value(s) of the economic factor(s) underlying the considered downturn period identified in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation xx/xxx [RTS on economic downturn] and value(s) of the relevant economic factor(s) observed in the periods referred to in paragraph 32(b)(ii);",

            "630. The supervisory stress testing programme set out by the competent authorities should ensure at least the following: a. When designing methodologies and assumptions for use in supervisory stress tests, competent authorities should decide on the design and features of the exercise that are most suitable for its intended purpose, i.e. that are linked to the supervisory (or other) objectives set by the competent authority. b. When conducting supervisory stress tests on a wider sample of institutions, competent authorities may consider adopting the design of supervisory stress tests for different categories of institutions as set out in Section 2.4, especially if the exercise is top-down. c. Competent authorities should consider the appropriate timelines for conducting supervisory stress tests, including the time horizon of the scenarios and the period over which the management actions proposed by institutions in the stress test exercise are analysed. The timelines for the exercise should also factor in the dialogue with the institution, where relevant for the intended purpose of the exercise and the extent to which the data supplied by the participating institution will remain relevant. d. Competent authorities should consider, where relevant for the intended purpose of the exercise, all known future regulatory changes affecting institutions within the scope and time horizon of the exercise.",
            "631. In the case of a scenario analysis stress test, competent authorities should decide whether to run a single scenario to be applied to all institutions included in the scope of the exercise, or to develop institution-specific scenarios for individual institutions (the latter should not be seen 225 as relieving institutions from the responsibility of designing own scenarios for the purposes of ICAAP and ILAAP stress testing), or a combination of the two. Competent authorities should consider the transferability of capital and liquidity resources in stressed conditions and any possible impediments, including legal and operational impediments, that may exist.",
            "632. Furthermore, the following aspects should be considered when developing the methodologies for supervisory stress tests: a. For the purposes of the assessment of capital adequacy, competent authorities should consider the impact of the stress test on the institution's P&L, balance sheet, risk exposure amount and leverage ratio, and analyse the impact of the stress test on the capital ratios of institutions covered by the exercise. b. For the purposes of bottom-up stress tests, competent authorities should consider the extent to which they prescribe the methodologies for modelling institutions' balance sheets and P&L. Indicatively, institutions' balance sheets may be taken as static, allowing competent authorities to assess current risks over time. Alternatively, they may be allowed to be dynamic, permitting, for example, a more forward-looking exploration of how institutions' business plans might evolve under the stress scenario or how credit volumes might evolve over time. For enhanced comparability, competent authorities may consider opting for the static balance sheet approach. Conversely, for enhanced feedback on institutions' intended or planned reactions vis-a-vis stresses and shocks, the dynamic balance sheet approach may be favoured. c. Competent authorities should consider how to take account of systemic feedback or second-round effects in the stress tests, where relevant, recognising the limitations of providing ex ante assumptions in the case of bottom-up stress tests. d. For the purposes of bottom-up supervisory stress tests, competent authorities should aim to assess the impact of such exercises consistently and fairly across the institutions covered by supervisory stress tests, respecting the level playing field. Competent authorities should also consider the extent to which stress test results reflect differences in modelling choices and judgements among institutions, rather than true differences in the risks to which they are exposed.",
            "633. Competent authorities should aim to assess model risk across stress testing exercises and have access to different types of comparative information. It is recommended to have, where appropriate, several perspectives/benchmarks. It is important to recognise that all models are imperfect and to clearly identify known and potential weaknesses. Understanding these limitations and weaknesses of individual institutions' stress testing models can inform the supervisory stress testing process and mitigate potential problems arising from model risk. 226 Annexes Annex 1.

            "4.1: Do you agree with the proposed requirements with regard to the application of appropriate adjustments and margin of conservatism? Do you have any operational concerns with respect to the proposed categorisation? MoC general framework One respondent wondered whether the categories and examples included in the background and rationale section of the CP should be seen as a checklist of potential triggers of MoC, in the sense that the potential outcome for an institution may be a zero MoC for certain triggers. One respondent agreed that this should be the case, but another respondent argued that such a checklist would be strictly interpreted by supervisors as requiring an MoC for each individual category. This respondent disagreed with this annex. Due to the confusion about the nature of the list of triggers of MoC in the background and rationale section of the CP, the list has been removed from the final GL. Due to the specificities of triggers of MoC, it is deemed more appropriate to allow institutions to specify a list of all identified deficiencies along with the categories in which they are classified, without including in the GL an example of what such list of triggers might look like. Nevertheless, the GL do contain a non-exhaustive list of triggers of MoC, which institutions should analyse under the relevant categories. Institutions should also create for each rating system a complete list of Changes to the background and rationale section 123 GUIDELINES ON PD ESTIMATION, LGD ESTIMATION AND TREATMENT DEFAULTED EXPOSURES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received EBA analysis Amendments to the proposals references to final GL all identified deficiencies, including the categories in which these deficiencies are classified. Whereas several respondents welcomed the clarification of the MoC and adjustment framework set out in the GL, many raised concerns with respect to the practical feasibility of quantifying all MoCs for the individual categories. Some also mentioned that institutions currently already include adjustments and MoC in their estimations. Some respondents wondered whether the benefits of the proposed framework outweighed the costs. One bank argued that it would be operationally difficult to implement this framework by end-2020. One respondent argued that an MoC should only be applied as a last-resort measure, and that other ways to address a deficiency should be explored first. One respondent argued that the MoC framework introduced judgement and subjectivity, which comes at the expense of risk sensitivity. Based on this feedback, it has been decided to construct a different list of categories, which should facilitate the quantification of MoC by category, so that overlaps between triggers of MoC in different categories can be avoided. The new categories to be identified are the following: category A - MOC related to data and methodological deficiencies; category B - MoC related to relevant changes to underwriting standards, risk appetite, collection and recovery policies, and any other source of additional uncertainty; category C - general estimation error. The GL contain a non-exhaustive list of deficiencies that would fall into categories A and B. Changes to section 4.4 Some respondents opined that the scope of MoCs should be clarified, as should the methodologies that should be used (i.e. using confidence intervals or otherwise). Others mentioned that the GL should specify how the quantification should be performed. Although the EBA considered specifying how MoC should be quantified, it has been taken into account that a wide variety of practices exists, which corresponds to the different possible natures of the potential deficiencies and uncertainties. Therefore, the preferred approach, taken in the GL, is to specify a list of minimum conditions for the quantification of MoCs in each category, without prescribing a detailed methodology. As regards the clarification of the scope of MoC, it should be mentioned that an MoC should cover at least the expected range of Changes to section 4.4.3 124 GUIDELINES ON PD ESTIMATION, LGD ESTIMATION AND TREATMENT DEFAULTED EXPOSURES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received EBA analysis Amendments to the proposals references to final GL estimation errors, as required by Article 179(1)(f) and Article 180(1)(e) of the CRR. Since it would be impossible to anticipate all possible triggers of MoC, the GL contain a non-exhaustive list of potential deficiencies. Several respondents requested that the GL clarify that an MoC may be zero. It is specified in the GL that an MoC stemming from category C (general estimation error) should be greater than zero, whereas an MoC corresponding to category A or B should be greater than or equal to zero. Changes to paragraph 47 One respondent mentioned that the GL should clarify whether an adjustment may be negative, that an MoC may also be positive, and whether adjustments and MoC may or should be used together. Paragraph 26 of the CP on the GL already makes clear that the appropriate adjustment may be either positive or negative. This clarification has been retained in the final GL in paragraph 39. No change Some respondents requested clarification of the interaction between the use test and the MoC. Two respondents wonder whether it would still be possible to pass the use test after the implementation of the MoC framework under the GL. It was argued that institutions might typically want to use the model with the economic adjustment, and without the MoC, or with a lower MoC than the regulatory requirement, for their internal purposes. A new section 8.3. has been inserted in the final GL in order to clarify aspects related to the use test. The GL provide an exhaustive list of possible deviations from the parameters used for own funds requirements calculation that can be applied for internal purposes. However, the use of parameters in both obligatory and optional areas of the use test does not preclude taking into account information from other sources as well. The combination of the information on internal ratings or risk parameters and any other relevant information should lead to an appropriate management decision in accordance with the institution's policy. The requirements for the use test specified in these GL should be read New section 8.3 125 GUIDELINES ON PD ESTIMATION, LGD ESTIMATION AND TREATMENT DEFAULTED EXPOSURES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received EBA analysis Amendments to the proposals references to final GL together with the RTS on IRB assessment methodology, which in Articles 18 to 21 specify obligatory and optional areas of the use test. One respondent argued that the MoC framework proposed in the GL should be applied only to new model approvals and material model changes, and that it would be inappropriate to require retrospective application of the framework to existing models. Another respondent flagged this aspect as well, pointing out that the treatment of existing models is not clear from the GL. The EBA issued its Opinion on the implementation of the revision of the IRB Approach 14 in February 2016; the expected implementation timeline is specified in it based on previous consultations. In this opinion, it is established that the full review of internal models should be implemented by end-2020. The MoC framework is an integral part of PD and LGD estimation, and hence all internal models will have to comply with the final GL as well as the other aspects of the new regulatory framework by end- 2020. No change Identification of deficiencies Several respondents argued that the EBA should provide definitions for the categories and methodological aspects of MoC estimation. It was mentioned that the differences between categories A, B, C and D were not clear. It was also suggested that further standardisation of the criteria for the adjustments and MoC identification and quantification should be provided. For some respondents, it was mainly category C that was unclear. Some mentioned that, without this clarification, the MoC framework would lead to even less comparable estimates among banks. The EBA has further discussed the scope and definitions of the various categories. Based on the comments and difficulties associated with certain overlaps, it has been decided to redesign the categories and provide greater clarity where necessary. Note that paragraph 38 of the final GL contains a non-exhaustive list of potential deficiencies that should be analysed. Given the divergent nature of deficiencies and the multitude of possible methodologies that can be used to assess the appropriate adjustments and the MoC, it would not be beneficial to specify or limit methodologies for either the appropriate adjustments or the Changes to section 4.4"

            "132. Institutions should be aware that relevant risk parameters related to operational risk may derive from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, including legal risks, or from external events, and may affect all products and activities within the institution.",
            "133. . In order to stress relevant risk parameters, institutions should use the profit and loss (P&L) effect of operational losses as the main metric. Any intrinsic impact caused by the operational risk event should be considered as an operational risk loss (e.g. intrinsic impacts from opportunity costs, or internal costs such as overtime/bonuses, etc., where they relate to an operational risk event). In addition, and only for the purpose of stress testing, any loss of future earnings caused by operational risk events (excluding second-line effects on the macroeconomic environment) should be included. At least the institutions under the advanced measurement approach (AMA) should also take these losses into account as they flow into the internal loss database to calculate the additional capital requirements. When using historical data, external data or scenarios as inputs for both P&L and RWA projections, institutions should take into account and avoid possible double-counting effects on the input side. 38 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INSTITUTIONS' STRESS TESTING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY",
            "134. As operational losses may induce second-round effects (i.e. reputational risk), in order to account for such effects, the operational risk stress testing programme should be thoroughly integrated into the institution-wide stress test and should include interconnections with liquidity and own funds requirements. Institutions should analyse at least: a) the exposure of the institution to activities and its associated risk culture and past record of operational losses, with a focus on the level and change in losses and gross income in the past few years; b) the business environment, including geographical locations, in which the institution operates and macroeconomic conditions; c) the evolution in headcount and in balance-sheet size and complexity over the past few years, including structural changes due to corporate events such as mergers and acquisitions; d) changes to significant elements of the information technology infrastructure; e) the degree and orientation of incentivising in compensation schemes; f) the complexity of processes and procedures, products and information technology systems; g) the extent of outsourcing, with regard to the concentration risk associated with all outsourcing arrangements and external market infrastructures; and h) the vulnerability of modelling risk, especially in areas related to the trading of financial instruments, risk measurement and management, and capital allocation.",
            "135. Idiosyncratic risk factors should also be explored and used as inputs for scenario design. Indicatively, institutions under the AMA should stress their business environment and internal control factors (BEICFs).",
            "136. Institutions should consider the interactions of, and individual exposures to, such idiosyncratic risk factors in determining their operational risk exposure.",
            "137. Institutions should analyse carefully the possible interaction of operational risk losses with credit and market risks.",
            "138. The analysis of the stress test events should involve expert judgement, to include at least low-frequency high-severity events.",
            "139. Institutions should design severe but plausible stress events. Assumptions may differ from assumptions used in credit and market risk stress scenarios. When an institution expands its business in the local or in the international markets through mergers and acquisitions, the design of new products or a new business line, the severe but plausible stress test scenarios should be based on expert judgement to overcome the possible lack of historical information.",
            "140. Institutions should build their stress testing programme based on both internal and external data, while analysing carefully: 39 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INSTITUTIONS' STRESS TESTING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY a) the use of scaling factors (e.g. in a situation where external data were scaled down, the scaling may be reduced) and the possible need for additional impacts stemming from changing scaling factors in a stress situation; and b) the criteria for determining the relevance of data (e.g. data on a large loss considered not relevant may be used within the stress test, in addition to Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) requirements)."
