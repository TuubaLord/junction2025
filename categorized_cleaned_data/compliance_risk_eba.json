Definitions (para. 11) Gender pay gap Some respondents noted that the definition of gender pay gap does not take into account the type of work, level of responsibility or experience, thus this definition is insufficient to meet the purpose of having gender-neutral remuneration policies and also differs from the 'equal pay for equal work or work of equal value'. In addition, it is proposed to replace the term 'earnings' with 'remuneration'; and the term 'hourly' with 'full-time annual remuneration awarded' or 'monthly/yearly remuneration' or 'gross annual remuneration'. In addition, it is proposed to link this definition with the methodology defined in section 2.5 In line with work published by the European Parliament39, the gender pay gap is the difference in average gross hourly earnings between women and men. It is based on salaries paid directly to employees before income tax and social security contributions are deducted. Calculated this way, the gender pay gap does not take into account all the different factors that may play a role, for example education, hours worked, type of job, career breaks or part-time work. The gender pay gap indicates more than just the difference in hourly or annual gross remuneration for the same job (which should not be different at all), but provides information on how successfully equal opportunities have been provided within society and within the institution. The GL were amended to replace unclear terms. GL amended",

            "1. Executive summary Directive 2014/59/EU1, establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions, investment firms and related entities (the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive, or BRRD) specifies a Union-wide framework for crisis prevention, management and resolution of these entities. These guidelines have been developed by the EBA, in close cooperation with the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), pursuant to Article 5(7) of the BRRD, and specify the range of scenarios of severe macroeconomic and financial distress which should be considered by institutions to test the effectiveness of recovery options and the adequacy of the indicators contained in their recovery plans. The objective of a recovery plan is not to forecast the factors that could prompt a crisis, but rather to identify the actions that might be available to counter those factors and to assess whether they are robust enough and their nature is sufficiently varied to cope with a wide range of shocks of different natures. For this purpose, the scenarios of severe macroeconomic and financial distress should be designed in a way that they would threaten the failure of an institution or group if recovery measures were not implemented in a timely manner. However, given that the aim of a recovery plan is to prove the capacity to restore the viability of an institution, these scenarios should be designed as 'near-default' situations; i.e. they should bring an institution close to failure but no further. This element should be taken into consideration for example when considering using reverse stress testing to identify the most appropriate scenarios. The guidelines stipulate that at least three scenarios of severe macroeconomic and financial distress should be included to ensure coverage of a system-wide event, an idiosyncratic event and a combination of system-wide and idiosyncratic events. In line with the principle of proportionality, global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs) and other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs) identified pursuant to Article 131 of the CRD should include at least four scenarios. The guidelines recognise that the risks that each institution faces vary significantly according to its business and funding model, its activities and structure, its size or its interconnectedness to other institutions or to the financial system in general. Moving from this premise, to ensure that recovery plans are tested against the main types of system-wide and idiosyncratic events, the guidelines identify the specific factors and events that should be taken into account in determining the appropriate scenarios. These factors have been selected as those that most typically threaten the failure of institutions or groups. However, the overriding principle remains 1 Directive 2014/59/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms and amending Council Directive 82/891/EEC, and Directives 2001/24/EC, 2002/47/EC, 2004/25/EC, 2005/56/EC, 2007/36/EC, 2011/35/EU, 2012/30/EU and 2013/36/EU, and Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010 and (EU) No 648/2012, (OJ L 173, 12.6.2014, p.190). 3 RUNNING TITLE COMES HERE IN RUNNING TITLE STYLE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY that the scenarios should be based on the events and factors that are the most relevant to the institution or group. Hence, different events should be used where those are more relevant. On this basis and in line with the provisions of the BRRD on the assessment of recovery plans and the related technical standards pursuant to Article 6(8), competent authorities will assess the adequacy of the scenarios chosen by the banks. The EBA launched a public consultation on 20 May 2013 (EBA/CP/2013/09) on the guidelines. The decision behind this early consultation stage was to allow phasing of the delivery of the large number of technical standards/guidelines that the EBA is required to produce as mandated by the BRRD. By the time the consultation was launched, the EBA was mandated to develop technical standards for the range of scenarios to be used by firms to test their recovery plans. Following the change of the mandate, the draft technical standards have been transposed to fit the structure of the guidelines, whilst also taking into account the feedback received from respondents during the consultation period. The comments received from stakeholders have been considered. Comments, the EBA's analysis and any consequent changes to the guidelines are reported in the feedback table at the end of this paper. The guidelines are structured into three titles. The first title establishes the subject matter and scope of the guidelines. Title 2 provides design principles for the range of scenarios and the range of scenarios to be considered. Finally, Title 3 determines when the guidelines take effect. 4 RUNNING TITLE COMES HERE IN RUNNING TITLE STYLE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY",
            "2. Background and rationale At the international level, any initiatives on recovery and resolution planning are carried out under the auspices of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), which in its Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions2 identifies the essential elements of recovery and resolution plans, and recommends recovery and resolution plans to be in place at least for any financial institution that could be systemically significant or critical if it fails. At the EU level, co-legislators have adopted Directive 2014/59/EU (the BRRD), establishing a recovery and resolution framework in the European Union. The EBA has developed these guidelines in accordance with the mandate contained in Article 5(7) of the BRRD, which mandates the EBA to develop guidelines to specify the range of scenarios of severe macroeconomic and financial distress to be used to assess the arrangements that institutions have in place and the measures that would be adopted to maintain or restore the institutions' viability in a timely manner. Rationale and regulatory approach followed in the GL The BRRD stipulates in Article 5(6) that the competent authorities should ensure that firms test their recovery plans against a range of scenarios of severe macroeconomic and financial distress, varying in their severity, including system-wide events, legal entity-specific stress and group-wide stress, while Article 7(6) requires group recovery plans to include a range of recovery options specifying actions to address those scenarios. At the same time Article 5(7) of the BRRD mandates the EBA to develop, in close cooperation with the ESRB, guidelines specifying the range of scenarios to be used for the purposes of Article 5(6). Following this mandate, these guidelines are prepared taking into account the FSB Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions, the FSB Guidance on Recovery Triggers and Stress Scenarios, and current supervisory practices. The guidelines cover the key elements and essential issues that should be addressed by institutions when developing severe macroeconomic and financial distress scenarios against which the recovery plan will be tested. Drafting a recovery plan is incumbent upon institutions or groups and is to be undertaken prior to a crisis in order to assess the potential options that an institution or a group could itself implement to restore financial strength and viability should the institution or group come under severe stress. Recovery plans must be based on the assumption that extraordinary public financial support would not be provided. Financial institutions are responsible for drafting and owning their own plans, but they will be assessed by the relevant competent authority or authorities."

            "37. By the time the consultation was launched, Article 5(7) of the BRRD mandated the EBA to develop technical standards for the range of scenarios to be used by firms to test their recovery plans. The following summary and table are composed on the basis of the feedback received for the draft technical standards, although the mandate was subsequently changed to require guidelines in the legislative procedure. Following the change to the mandate, the draft technical standards were transposed to fit the structure of guidelines, whilst also taking into account the feedback received from respondents during the consultation period. Summary of key issues and the EBA's response In total, sixteen (16) responses were received; two (2) respondents asked for their response not to be published but the remainder were published on the EBA website. On the whole, the respondents welcomed the proposals and the efforts to harmonise the practices with scenarios that are being used to test the recovery plans. Many of the respondents welcomed the emphasis that scenarios should be used to test the recovery plan and to facilitate its assessment and the ability of the group to recover, rather than building recovery plans around a given set of scenarios. Some of the respondents considered the proposals too detailed or prescriptive to fit individual institutions, advocating more flexibility. It was considered that 'over-engineered' scenarios may create a ranking or hierarchy of recovery options for each particular scenario. Furthermore, recovery plans need to be tailor-made for each institution/group and appropriately reflect its specificities. The range of respondents' views was quite wide as far as the testing of the recovery plans on the group or individual level was concerned. Some respondents claimed that scenarios should be developed and tested at group level only, while others replied that they have already developed scenarios to test recovery plans both at individual and group level and considered these as useful. Some respondents argued that it is important to focus only on a few scenarios that are truly relevant to the institutions. This view was endorsed in particular in those cases when the respondent was supporting testing at group level only. 15 RUNNING TITLE COMES HERE IN RUNNING TITLE STYLE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY One issue that was raised in many replies related to the suggestion to adopt reverse stress testing as a tool for identifying scenarios that would threaten to cause the failure of the institution. Some respondents considered this to be a useful tool, whereas others considered the additional value of reverse stress testing of scenarios to be of minor significance. Some respondents considered that the proposals do not cover coordination between home/host authorities, which may give rise to significant additional costs for banks resulting from the preparation of local recovery plans. One respondent requested clarification on whether and how the 'simplified obligations' for smaller and simpler institutions are to be applied in the context of recovery plans. 16 RUNNING TITLE COMES HERE IN RUNNING TITLE STYLE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY"

These guidelines focus exclusively on the issue of connected clients under Article 4(1)(39) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and apply to all areas of that Regulation where the concept of connected clients is used, i.e. the large exposures regime (Part Four of that Regulation), the categorisation of clients in the retail exposure class for the purposes of credit risk (Article 123(c) and Article 147(5)(a)(ii)), the development and application of rating systems (Article 172(1)(d)) and the SME supporting factor (Article 501(2)(c)). The guidelines also apply to EBA technical standards and EBA guidelines that refer to 'groups of connected clients' as defined in Article 4(1)(39) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, namely in the area of liquidity reporting, where this concept is used in the specification of items requiring stable funding that must be reported to the competent authorities (Article 428(1)(g)(ii) of that Regulation), and in the reporting of concentration of funding by counterparty and concentration of counterbalancing capacity by issuer/counterpart.4 Additionally, the guidelines take into account developments in the areas of shadow banking and large exposures at EU and international levels. 5",

The objective of the definition of 'connected clients' in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 is to identify clients so closely linked by idiosyncratic risk factors that it is prudent to treat them as a single risk. Idiosyncratic risk represents the effect of risks that are specific to individual clients. Idiosyncratic risk arises where, in a bilateral interrelationship, financial problems of one entity are transferred via this interrelationship to another entity that otherwise would not be concerned.

            "29.Having information about connected clients is essential to an institution's understanding of the risks it is exposed to and also to limiting the impact of unforeseen events. In this regard, institutions should have in place a robust process for investigating and identifying connections among clients. To this end, institutions should take reasonable steps to collect and use all relevant information; this includes publicly available information, information beyond the institutions' clients and also 'soft information' that typically exists at the level of individual loan officers and relationship managers.",
            "30.On the basis of the available information, institutions should be able to identify all control relationships and economic dependencies among their clients, regardless of the size of their exposures. The guidelines acknowledge, however, the inherent difficulty of identifying economic dependencies among clients and state that institutions should strengthen their investigations in all cases where the sum of all exposures to one individual client exceeds 5% of Tier 1 capital.",
            "31.It is important to note that institutions should also collect information on all entities forming a 'chain of contagion' to be able to correctly identify groups of connected clients. However, if there are interconnections among entities with which the institution has no business relation (and thus has not collected any information with regard to possible interconnections), the correct identification of a group of connected clients might not be possible. Naturally, if an institution becomes aware of such interconnections via entities outside its clientele (e.g. through press statements), it needs to incorporate this information into its grouping practice.",
            "32.It will rarely be possible to implement automated procedures for identifying economic interconnections; therefore, case-by-case analysis and judgement should be used. As the determination of economic interconnection is dependent on the one hand on the information available to or gathered by the institution and on the other hand on economic judgement, it is possible that different institutions will arrive at different results when analysing the same entities. Supervisors should be aware of this issue and, depending on the specific case, may accept or challenge such differences. 12 GUIDELINES ON CONNECTED CLIENTS EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY",

The Guidelines aim to ensure that such assessments are conducted in an appropriate timeframe, considering the urgency of the situation, and that there is an appropriate interaction between competent authorities and resolution authorities. In contrast, the assessment of special managers under Article 35(1) of BRRD falls exclusively within the competence of resolution authorities, which appoint a special manager under the conditions of Article 35(1) of BRRD, namely an assessment of whether the special manager has the qualifications, ability and knowledge required to carry out his or her functions.

            "5. Directive (EU) 2015/849 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing requires that credit or financial institutions have in place policies, controls and procedures to mitigate and manage effectively the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF). In accordance with Article 8(4) of this Directive, where appropriate with regard to the size and nature of the business, credit or financial institutions have to appoint a compliance officer at the management level. Article 46(4) further provides that credit or financial institutions that have a management body also identify the member of the management body who is ultimately responsible for the implementation of the law, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with AML/CFT requirements.",
            "6. These provisions complement requirements in other sectoral laws that relate to credit or financial institutions' governance and risk management systems, and suitability requirements for senior function holders.",
            "7. In 2017, in its Supranational Risk Assessment, the European Commission asked the ESAs to develop guidance to clarify the role of AML/CFT compliance officers in credit or financial institutions. At the time, the ESAs considered that existing guidelines on internal governance were sufficient to fulfil the Commission's request.",
            "8. There have, however, been a number of reports that suggest that the requirements set out in Directive (EU) 2015/849 have been implemented unevenly across different sectors and Member States, and that they are not always applied effectively. This can have adverse consequences for the integrity of the EU's financial system.",
            "9. For example, a) In their 2017 Joint Opinion on the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing affecting the Union's financial sector1, the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) considered that the Union's financial sector was exposed to money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risks arising from ineffective AML/CFT systems and controls. Findings from national supervisors pointed to a number of causes for these shortcomings. These included senior management of some credit or financial institutions affording low priority to AML/CFT issues, in particular when paired with a corporate culture that pursues profits at the expense of robust compliance. This lack of senior management buy-in meant that ensuring adequate resources and hiring suitably qualified staff for AML/CFT roles were not seen as a priority, which appeared to affect the quality of financial institutions' AML/CFT controls. 1 JC/2017/07 of 20 February 2017 4 FINAL REPORT AND GUIDELINES ON THE ROLE OF THE AML/CFT COMPLIANCE OFFICER EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY b) The 2019 Report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the assessment of recent alleged money laundering cases involving EU credit institutions2 found that many credit institutions in the Commission's sample had not established adequate risk management systems and controls. The analysis revealed deficiencies in credit institutions' anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism-related governance arrangements (including the 'three lines of defence'), their internal reporting, group policies and senior managements' responsibilities and accountability. c) The EBA found in its 2019/2020 AML/CFT reviews of competent authorities' approaches to the AML/CFT supervision of banks3 that AML/CFT supervisors in some Member States did not interact with financial institutions' senior management because there was no legal or regulatory requirement in those Member States to appoint an AML/CFT compliance officer at a level that was sufficiently senior to report to the financial institution's senior management body. As a result, in those Member States there was a risk that AML/CFT supervision may not be effective. d) The EBA noted in its 2021 Opinion on the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing affecting the European Union's financial sector4 that there was still a sizeable proportion of competent authorities that considered that the quality of some controls had remained poor and many competent authorities identified persisting deficiencies in some key controls. Rationale",
            "10.The EBA has a legal duty to prevent the use of the EU's financial system for ML/TF purposes, and a mandate to lead, monitor and coordinate the EU financial sector's fight against ML/TF. Through these guidelines, the EBA aims to achieve a common understanding, by competent authorities and credit or financial institutions, of the role and responsibilities of a. the AML/CFT compliance officer; and b. the management body with regard to AML/CFT or the senior manager where no management body exists.",
            "11.A common understanding of the role and responsibilities of AML/CFT compliance officers and the management body or senior manager, which is applied and enforced consistently, is important to ensure that credit or financial institutions in all Member States implement sound and effective AML/CFT systems and controls and to protect the EU's financial sector from financial crime.

Executive Summary Article 84(6) of the Directive 2013/36/EU1 (Capital Requirements Directive - CRD) mandates the EBA to issue Guidelines to specify the criteria for the evaluation by an institution's internal system of the interest rate risk of an institution's non-trading book activities (IRRBB) as well as the criteria for the identification, management and mitigation by institutions of the IRRBB either if it implements internal systems, the standardised approach or the simplified standardised approach. The EBA published in July 2018 Guidelines \"on the management of interest rate risk arising from non-trading book activities\" (\"the 2018 Guidelines\") that apply from June 2019 with dedicated provisions on these aspects. The current Guidelines replace the 2018 EBA Guidelines as some of its parts will be covered by dedicated RTS and the amended mandate includes new aspects as explained below. These new Guidelines maintain continuity with the previous Guidelines as far as possible, while updating some elements. The Guidelines are broadly consistent with the Basel standards with some further elaborated sections following the CRD mandate, particularly on CSRBB assessment and monitoring and non- satisfactory IRRBB internal systems. The EBA is mandated to specify in these Guidelines additional criteria for the assessment and monitoring by institutions of their credit spread risk arising from their non-trading book activities (CSRBB). The Guidelines provide a definition and the scope of application of CSRBB. They contain dedicated sections for CSRBB with specific provisions on the identification, assessment and monitoring of CSRBB. Finally, the mandate requests the inclusion of criteria for determining whether the internal systems implemented by institutions for the purpose of evaluating IRRBB are not satisfactory, in which case a competent authority may require an institution to use the standardised methodology. After some general provisions, the Guidelines contain separate specific chapters for IRRBB and for CSRBB. Next steps The guidelines will be translated into the official EU languages and published on the EBA website. The deadline for competent authorities to report whether they comply with the guidelines will be two months after the publication of the translations. Upon publication of these Guidelines, the 2018 Guidelines are repealed and replaced.

            "2. Background and rationale Introduction The concept of the Internal Ratings Based (IRB) Approach for credit risk was first introduced by Directives 2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC of 14 June 2006 (known as the Capital Requirements Directive), later replaced by Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (Capital Requirements Regulation - CRR) and Directive 2013/36/EU of 26 June 2013 (Capital Requirements Directive - CRD). The CRR introduced a number of mandates for the European Banking Authority (EBA) to develop technical standards and guidelines to supplement the basic legislation in order to ensure more harmonised application of the IRB requirements. In this regard and in accordance with Article 502 of the CRR, the EBA published in December 2013 a set of five reports on the comparability and pro-cyclicality of capital requirements, presenting the results of a study conducted by the EBA on the comparability of risk estimates and capital requirements, including analysis of the factors that contribute to discrepancies among institutions. Based on the results, the EBA concluded that further guidance was needed, as current practices differed significantly across countries and institutions. Consequently, the EBA initiated work to provide further regulatory guidance, and these Guidelines on PD estimation, LGD estimation and the treatment of defaulted exposures (GL) are one of the resulting initiatives, specifically targeting the significant discrepancies identified in the methodologies underlying risk estimates. The sources of discrepancies identified in the area of modelling were related mostly to different definitions of the main concepts underlying the risk parameters, and different modelling choices made possible by the large degree of flexibility incorporated in the IRB framework. In addition, different understanding of regulatory requirements was also observed. These GL are therefore focused on aligning terminology and definitions, in particular in relation to metrics such as default rate or realised LGD, which are the basis for estimation of risk parameters. Furthermore, the GL provide clarification on the application of certain regulatory requirements which, until now, have been interpreted in various ways, and specify principles for the estimation of risk parameters, including those applicable to defaulted exposures. Although the GL may limit certain modelling choices, they are focused on the elements that lead to non-risk-based variability and intend to preserve sufficient flexibility to ensure risk sensitivity of the models. Therefore, the GL do not prescribe any specific estimation methodology, recognising that different approaches may be appropriate for different portfolios to reflect different risk profiles. The main objective of the GL is to provide the rules that will lead to increased comparability of the model outcomes. Differences in risk parameters between institutions should ideally reflect differences in the underlying risk rather than different modelling choices. In addition, clearer rules in that regard will limit the possibility for regulatory arbitrage. Other aspects of the models that are not explicitly prescribed in the GL, such as the choice of risk drivers and estimation methodology, will 5 GUIDELINES ON PD ESTIMATION, LGD ESTIMATION AND TREATMENT DEFAULTED EXPOSURES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY have to be justified on the basis of the risk profile of the portfolio covered by the model as well as the credit and recovery policies and efficiency of these processes. As the GL are part of a broader review of the IRB Approach carried out by the EBA they do not address all identified sources of risk-weighted asset (RWA) variability. The GL focus on aspects related to modelling of parameters such as PD, LGD, best estimate of expected loss (ELBE) and LGD in- default, whereas other elements, including the definition of default on which these parameters should be based, rating processes, data quality processes and other aspects of the application of the IRB Approach, are addressed in other regulatory products. The regulatory products, developed as part of the regulatory review of the IRB Approach as outlined in the Report published in February 20164, will affect nearly all aspects of the IRB Approach and, as a consequence, it is expected that they will be able to significantly reduce unjustified RWA variability, which is deemed to stem from the lack of sufficiently specified requirements with regard to certain aspects of the IRB Approach. These GL provide such specifications, where necessary, to achieve the objective of a Single Rulebook, as well as to regain public trust in the use of internal models. It has to be stressed that these GL include numerous references to the EBA draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on IRB assessment methodology5, which set conditions for competent authorities to assess the rating systems of institutions. As the RTS contain rules for competent authorities on their assessment of the IRB methodologies, they also provides details to institutions about how competent authorities are expected to understand and apply aspects of the CRR in the course of their assessment. Therefore, these GL and the RTS mentioned above should be read together, as many aspects related to modelling have already been clarified in the RTS, and in these cases the provisions are not repeated in the GL. When implementing any changes in the rating systems stemming from the regulatory review of the IRB Approach, and also subsequently on a continuous basis, institutions should take into account not only these GL but also provisions included in other related regulatory products, in particular in the RTS on IRB assessment methodology, the RTS on materiality threshold for past due credit obligations, the GL on the application of the definition of default, and the RTS on the nature, severity and duration of economic downturn. As the RTS on the nature, severity and duration of economic downturn are still under development the requirements regarding the estimation of downturn LGD have not been included in the GL at this stage. Once the RTS have specified the identification of the downturn period the GL will be updated by adding a section clarifying how the impact of economic downturn should be reflected in the LGD estimates. In order not to pre-empt any decisions that will be taken when specifying the final RTS, it is considered appropriate that the RTS on the nature, severity and duration of economic downturn and the relevant section of the GL should be published together. Neither these GL nor any of the EBA's other regulatory products address the issue of the scope of application of the IRB Approach and modellability of low-default portfolios. These aspects are 4https://www.eba.europa.eu/documents/10180/1360107/EBA+Report+on+the+regulatory+review+of+the+IRB+Approach. pdf"

            "1. Executive summary Article 21b of Directive 2013/36/EU introduced a requirement for institutions belonging to third- country groups to have an intermediate EU parent undertaking (IPU) established in the Union, where the total value of assets in the Union of the third-country group is equal to or greater than EUR 40 billion. The EBA considers that a common methodology for calculating the total value of assets in the Union as well as consistent supervisory expectations are essential for ensuring consistent application of the IPU requirement. Therefore, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, the EBA decided to provide this necessary guidance to the institutions that are part of third-country groups operating in the Union and to the competent authorities responsible for supervision over the institutions and branches belonging to the third-country groups. Following the suggestion of the European Commission expressed in its letter to the EBA, the guidelines clarify the relevant dates for the calculation of the total value of the assets in the Union, taking into account the fluctuation in the value of assets. In particular, the guidelines specify that for the purpose of the application of the IPU requirement, the total value of assets in the Union of the third-country group should be calculated as an average over the last four quarters. This value should be monitored on a quarterly basis and communicated to relevant competent authorities. In order to meet the IPU requirement in a timely manner it is necessary that institutions belonging to third-country groups apply a forward-looking approach. It is therefore specified that they should assess at least annually whether the threshold is expected to be reached within the three-year horizon, based on the strategic planning of the third-country group and the forecast of assets. For the purpose of both the quarterly assessments and the annual forward-looking monitoring, institutions and branches belonging to a third-country group should exchange between each other all necessary information. In addition, these guidelines specify certain procedural aspects related to the monitoring of the threshold by competent authorities and the establishment of the IPU where necessary. In particular, clarification is provided on the notifications required by Article 21b(6) of Directive 2013/36/EU, namely that these are to be provided to the EBA on an annual basis. In addition, certain exceptional situations are specified where competent authorities may identify appropriate timelines for the establishment of an IPU, no longer than up to two years from reaching the threshold. Relevant competent authorities should coordinate and take necessary measures to ensure adequate implementation of the IPU requirement. 3 FINAL REPORT ON THE EBA GUIDELINES ON THE MONITORING OF THE IPU THRESHOLD EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY",
