            "1. Executive Summary These guidelines are issued pursuant to Article 16(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 on the EBA's own initiative in order to ensure common, uniform and consistent application of Union law and to establish consistent, efficient and effective supervisory practices within the European System of Financial Supervision ('ESFS'). A significant number of credit institutions apply the International Financial Reporting Standards® ('IFRS® Standards') as these are incorporated into the EU legal framework through EU regulations, in accordance with the procedures set out in Regulation (EC) No 1606/20021. IFRS 9 Financial Instruments ('IFRS 9'), which will replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement ('IAS 39'), for the accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 20182, requires the measurement of impairment loss allowances to be based on an expected credit loss ('ECL') accounting model rather than on an incurred loss accounting model. The EBA welcomes the move from an incurred loss model to an ECL model under IFRS 93. IFRS 9 is, overall, an improvement compared with IAS 39 in the accounting for financial instruments, and the changes to credit loss provisioning should contribute to addressing the G20's concerns about the issue of 'too little, too late' recognition of credit losses, and improve the accounting recognition of loan loss provisions by incorporating a broader range of credit information. IFRS 9 is therefore expected to address some prudential concerns and contribute to financial stability. However, the application of IFRS 9 also requires the use of judgement in the ECL assessment and measurement process, which could potentially affect the consistent application of IFRS 9 across credit institutions and the comparability of credit institutions' financial statements. In December 2015, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ('BCBS') issued supervisory guidance on credit risk and accounting for expected credit losses4 (the 'BCBS guidance'), which sets out supervisory expectations for credit institutions related to sound credit risk practices associated with implementing and applying an ECL accounting model. In addition, it contains an Annex specific to jurisdictions applying IFRS. Building on the BCBS guidance, these guidelines aim at ensuring sound credit risk management practices for credit institutions, associated with the implementation and ongoing application of ECL accounting models. The existence of supervisory guidance emphasises the importance of 1 Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 July 2002 on the application of international accounting standards (OJ L 243, 11.9.2002, p. 1). 2 Commission Regulation (EU) No 2016/2067 of 22 November 2016 amending Regulation (EC) No 1126/2008 adopting certain international accounting standards in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards International Financial Reporting Standards 9. 3 Letter to the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group ('EFRAG') of 26 June 2015 with EBA's views on the adoption of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (http://www.eba.europa.eu/documents/10180/943157/Letter+to+EFRAG+Board+on+IFRS+9+endorsement.pdf)."

Recognising that credit institutions may have well-established regulatory capital models for the measurement of expected losses, these models may be used as a starting point for estimating ECL for accounting purposes; however, regulatory capital models may not be directly usable in the measurement of accounting ECL because of differences between the objectives of, and inputs used for, each of these purposes.",
            "12.As with all EBA guidelines, these guidelines should be read holistically with the understanding that the examples provided are not all-inclusive and that a checklist approach to applying these guidelines is not intended. While these guidelines are to be applied for the assessment of credit risk from, and the measurement of ECL on, lending exposures under the applicable accounting framework, they do not set out principles and expectations targeted at specific categories of loans such as corporate, retail and project finance. In this regard, certain aspects of the guidelines may be more applicable to the individual credit assessment of a large corporate borrower, while other aspects may be more relevant to collective assessments of a particular group of retail customers.

Furthermore, they set out the supervisory expectations for credit institutions related to sound credit risk practices associated with implementing and applying an ECL accounting model.",
            "14.In particular, on the considerations on proportionate application of the EBA guidelines, the EBA notes that all credit institutions applying IFRS 9 should ensure that they meet the objectives of IFRS 9 when applying the standard. However, the EBA understands that the way of meeting these objectives may differ across credit institutions; for example, different techniques or models may be used in the measurement of ECL. Credit institutions should comply with these guidelines in a proportionate manner taking into account various criteria, such as their size and internal organisation and the nature, scope and complexity of their activities and portfolios, as described in paragraph 17 of the guidelines. Credit institutions should, however, take into consideration if using practical expedients that the objective of IFRS 9 is to estimate ECL to reflect an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes (IFRS 9, paragraph 5.5.17)",

In cases when a credit institution's individual assessments of exposures do not adequately consider forward-looking information, and in order to allow identification of relationships between forward-looking information and ECL estimates that may not be apparent at the individual level, an institution should group lending exposures with shared credit risk characteristics to estimate the impact of forward-looking information, including macroeconomic factors. Conversely, when credit institutions determine that all reasonable and supportable forward-looking information has been incorporated in the individual assessment of ECL, an additional forward-looking assessment should not be conducted on a collective basis if that could result in double counting."

However, ECL estimates must not ignore the impact of (forward-looking) events and conditions on those drivers. The estimate should reflect the expected future cash shortfalls resulting from such impact.",
            "70. Consideration of forward-looking information should not be avoided on the basis that a credit institution considers the cost of incorporating such forward-looking information to be very high or unnecessary or because there is uncertainty in formulating forward-looking scenarios, unless the additional cost and operational burden to be introduced do not contribute to a high-quality implementation of an ECL accounting framework.",

Credit institutions should be able to demonstrate that the forward-looking information factored into the ECL estimation process has a link to the credit risk drivers for particular exposures or portfolios. Given that it may not be possible to demonstrate a strong link in formal statistical terms between certain types of information, or even the information set as a whole, and the credit risk drivers, credit institutions should use their experienced credit judgement in establishing an appropriate level for the individual or collective allowance.

Macroeconomic forecasts and other relevant information should be applied consistently across portfolios where the credit risk drivers of the portfolios are affected by these forecasts/assumptions in the same way. Furthermore, when developing ECL estimates, credit institutions should apply their experienced credit judgement to consider their point in the credit cycle, which may differ across the jurisdictions in which they have lending exposures.",

When adopting a definition of default for accounting purposes, credit institutions should be guided by the definition used for regulatory purposes provided in Article 178 of Regulation (EU) 575/201329, which includes both: a. a qualitative criterion by which 'the institution considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the institution, the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries in full, without recourse by the institution to actions such as realising security' ('unlikeliness to pay' events); and b. an objective indicator where 'the obligor is past due more than 90 days on any material credit obligation to the institution, the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries', equivalent to the rebuttable presumption in IFRS 9, paragraph B5.5.37.",

Credit institutions should exercise experienced credit judgement to consider both qualitative and quantitative information that may affect the credit institution's assessment of credit risk. IFRS 9 provides that an entity does not need to undertake an exhaustive search for information when measuring an amount equal to 12- month ECL. However, credit institutions should actively incorporate information that may affect the estimate of ECL, and credit institutions should not exclude or ignore relevant information that is reasonably available.",

The rationale for this approach is that the creditworthiness of the counterparty, and thus the ECL anticipated upon initial recognition, is taken into account in the pricing of credit at that time. It follows, then, that a post-origination increase in credit risk may not be fully compensated by the interest rate charged, and, as a consequence, credit institutions should carefully consider whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk30. If so, the lending exposure should be subject to lifetime ECL measurement.",
            "98. In order to consider whether an exposure has suffered a significant increase in credit risk and the measurement of required 12-month ECL and lifetime ECL, credit institutions should have in place sound governance, systems and controls, in accordance with the principles specified in these guidelines. Unless already established, credit institutions should implement systems that are capable of handling and systematically assessing the large amounts of information that will be required to judge whether or not particular lending exposures or groups of lending exposures exhibit a significant increase in credit risk, and to measure lifetime ECL where that is the case. Parent undertakings and subsidiaries subject to Directive 2013/36/EU should ensure that the approach is consistent across the group. This should include, in particular, putting in place processes to ensure that forecasts of economic conditions in different jurisdictions and economic sectors are reviewed and approved by a credit institution's senior management, and that the process, controls and economic assumptions around developing forecasts and linking these to expectations of credit loss are consistent across the group. The need for consistency should not be interpreted as a requirement that the practice be identical across a group. On the contrary, within a consistent framework there may be differences across jurisdictions and products, depending for instance on the availability of data. These differences should be well documented and justified.",

However, all lending exposures that have an 'investment grade' rating from a credit rating agency cannot automatically be considered low credit risk. Credit institutions should rely primarily on their own credit risk assessments in order to evaluate the credit risk of a lending exposure, and not rely solely or mechanistically on ratings provided by credit rating agencies (where the latter are available). Nevertheless, optimistic internal credit ratings, as compared with external ratings, should require additional analysis and justification by a credit institution's management body or senior management.

Any assertion that the more-than-30-days-past-due presumption is rebutted on the basis that there has not been a significant increase in credit risk should be accompanied by a thorough analysis clearly demonstrating that 30 days past due is not correlated with a significant increase in credit risk32. Such analysis should consider both current and reasonable and supportable forward-looking information that may cause future cash shortfalls to differ from historical experience.",

Moreover, credit institutions should take into account that significant reliance on backward-looking information will introduce bias into the implementation of an ECL accounting model and that they should ensure that the objectives of the IFRS 9 impairment requirements (i.e. to reflect ECL that meet the stated measurement objectives and to capture all significant increases in credit risk) are met."

            "6. The reasoning behind the current guidelines is that where a control relationship exists the controlling person/entity has legally enforceable rights that establish a strong form of financial dependency on the controlling person/entity by the controlled entity. In case of financial problems of the controlling person/entity, it is highly likely that the controlling person/entity could make use of its rights to extract capital and/or liquidity from the controlled entity, thereby weakening the financial position of the latter. Financial problems could be transferred to the controlled entity, with the result that both the controlling person/entity and the controlled entity would experience financial problems ('domino effect'). From the perspective of prudential risk stemming from exposures to clients, it is therefore appropriate to attach the strong assumption of a single risk to a relationship of control between different clients.",
            "7. The definition of 'control' in Article 4(1)(37) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 points to the accounting definition of the relationship between a parent undertaking and a subsidiary, as defined in the new Accounting Directive 2013/34/EU6 or the accounting standards to which an institution is subject under Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002,7 or a similar relationship between any natural or legal person and an undertaking. Therefore, where the new Accounting Directive 2013/34/EU is applicable, it has an impact on the way institutions assess control relationships for the purposes of grouping connected clients. 6 Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on the annual financial statements, consolidated financial statements and related reports of certain types of undertakings, amending Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC. 7 Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 July 2002 on the application of international accounting standards. 7 GUIDELINES ON CONNECTED CLIENTS EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY",
            "8. Article 22(1) and (2) of Directive 2013/34/EU sets out several options and national discretions for Member States as regards the transposition of such provisions, thus leaving the definition of 'group' for the purpose of consolidation of accounts to the Member States. Consequently, the definition of 'control' for the purpose of forming groups of connected clients will also depend on the national transposition of these options and national discretions. The present guidelines regarding the 'control' criterion respect the national transpositions of Directive 2013/34/EU, which may potentially lead to different grouping requirements depending on where institutions' clients are required to prepare their consolidated financial statements.",
            "9. These guidelines clarify that institutions should make use of their clients' consolidated financial statements8 when assessing connections based on control. For clients to which the EU accounting rules do not apply (e.g. natural persons, central governments and clients that prepare consolidated accounts in accordance with the accounting rules of a third country), the guidelines provide a non-exhaustive list of criteria and indicators of control. This list is divided into two different sets: the first set consists of criteria that always constitute a control relationship among clients; the second set includes examples of indicators that should be considered by institutions in their assessment, as any of these indicators might constitute a control relationship among clients.",
            "10.In addition, the guidelines clarify the concept of 'single risk' and also that the burden of proof is on the institution to demonstrate that, despite the existence of a control relationship among clients, those clients, by way of exception, do not constitute a single risk.",
            "11.Finally, it is noted that the assessment of control relationships is only the first step in the assessment of the connections among clients, before assessing any potential economic dependency."

Thus, these entities are not eligible for a separate assessment of the existence of a group of connected clients.9",

Economic dependencies among such entities need to be reflected in separate groups of connected clients (not including the central government). The alternative approach looks only at the relationship between the central government and entities directly connected to it. The idiosyncratic risk that might arise in the relationship among such entities needs to be assessed separately.",

            "20.Even if the issue of control of one client over another does not apply, institutions are obliged to assess whether there exists a relationship of economic dependency among clients. If it is likely that the financial problems of one client would cause difficulties for the other(s) in terms of full and timely repayment of liabilities, there exists an idiosyncratic risk that needs to be addressed by considering the clients to be connected. An economic dependency among clients may be mutual or only one way.",
            "21.Dependency might arise in the context of business interconnections (e.g. supply chain links, dependence on large customers or counterparty exposures, financial dependency) that are not linked to sectorial or geographical risks, and it suggests that the clients involved are exposed to the same idiosyncratic risk factor. If this idiosyncratic risk materialises, one or both obligors are likely to experience repayment difficulties. Consequently, interconnections among entities (or persons) due to bilateral business relationships may lead to contagion risk that is independent of sectorial or geographical risks. The fact that the existence of common idiosyncratic risk factors may lead to contagion risk for otherwise independent clients is at the core of the concept of economic interconnection.",
            "22.The rationale for the definition of economic interconnection in Article 4(1)(39)(b) is to identify channels of contagion stemming from economic dependencies that a client cannot overcome without experiencing repayment difficulties. However, even if a client is dependent on another client through, for instance, a business relationship, it could still be possible for the client to easily find a replacement for this business partner (in case of its default), or to compensate for such a loss by other means, for example through reduction of costs or concentration on other sectors. This might cause practical problems, such as lower margins, but if an institution is able to demonstrate that it would not lead to repayment difficulties, there is no requirement to consider such clients as interconnected.",
            "23.It should be noted that a common source of funding due solely to geographical location does not, in itself, lead to a requirement to connect clients. Small and medium-sized entities will, in many cases, not have the capacity or commercial incentive to use institutions other than their local bank, and, in addition, for most of them the personal relationship with their banker is the key to better financial services. This fact does not in itself justify these clients being regarded as interconnected, even though they have a common source of funding (i.e. the reporting institution itself). Such funding dependencies differ from the funding dependencies described in these guidelines because the common source of funding is the result of the geographical location and can normally be replaced.",
            "24. Clients that depend on their existing source of funding simply because they are not creditworthy do not belong in this category. In the same way, being clients of the same institution does not in itself create a requirement to group the clients if the institution providing funding can be easily replaced. Institutions are not required to collect information about whether their clients share an 10 GUIDELINES ON CONNECTED CLIENTS EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY external common source of funding; however, institutions do need to take into account available information in this regard.",
            "25.Although these guidelines apply to exposures to shadow banking entities10 in the same way that they apply to exposures to other clients, the institution should pay particular attention when assessing connections among shadow banking entities. The EBA 'Guidelines on limits on exposures to shadow banking entities' define prudential expectations regarding groups of shadow banking entities. In this context, institutions should give due consideration to the fact that elements of control among these shadow banking entities will most likely consist not of equity ties but rather of a different type of relationship, i.e. situations of de facto control or relationships characterised by contractual obligations, implicit support or potential reputational risk (e.g. sponsorship or even branding). 11"

Although the joint efforts of banks, supervisors, regulators and macroprudential authorities have led to a slow improvement in NPE ratios in recent years, the overall level of NPEs remains high by historic standards, especially in some jurisdictions. In July 2017, the European Council concluded an Action Plan1 to tackle non- performing loans (NPLs) in Europe. The Council stressed that a comprehensive approach consisting of a mix of complementary policy actions, at national and European level, was needed to address the existing stock of NPLs as well as to prevent the emergence and accumulation of new NPEs on banks' balance sheets. In this regard, the EBA, along with other bodies and institutions, was invited by the Council to contribute to this Action Plan in four specific areas: (i) supervisory actions to work with banks to improve strategies to reduce NPEs; (ii) measures to improve the functioning of the secondary market; (iii) structural measures to improve the environment for dealing with NPEs; and (iv) fostering restructuring of the banking system. These guidelines relate to the first area. The guidelines are aimed primarily at reducing NPEs on banks' balance sheets by providing supervisory guidance to ensure that credit institutions effectively manage NPEs and forborne exposures (FBEs) on their balance sheets. The aim is to achieve a sustainable reduction of NPEs on credit institutions' balance sheets by means of the institutions' own NPE strategies, which would prove beneficial from both micro and macro perspectives. The guidelines are written from a prudential perspective but also taking into account the pressing need to ensure that consumers who have taken out loans are treated fairly at every stage of the loan life cycle. To that end, the guidelines draw attention specifically to provisions under the EU directives and relevant EBA guidelines relating to consumers of which credit institutions need to be cognisant when managing NPEs. The development and operationalisation of an NPE strategy is the core building block of the guidelines for banks' NPE management. The NPE strategy should be built on an assessment of the operating environment, should set out time-bound, credible yet ambitious reduction targets and should consider all available strategic options to reduce NPEs. The guidelines outline the proportionate approach to the key elements of governance and operations in relation to an NPE workout framework, covering aspects related to steering and decision-making, the NPE operating model, the internal control framework and NPE monitoring processes. Credit institutions with gross NPL ratios at a level of 5% or above should establish an NPE strategy, as part of their overall strategy, and related governance and operational arrangements. Effective governance covers all the responsibilities that banks have, including treating customers fairly. The guidelines stress that any forbearance measures should be granted only when they aim to restore sustainable repayment by the borrower and are thus in the borrower's interests. These"

            "1. The financial crisis negatively affected the European banking sector in various ways, and it contributed to the build-up of a large stock of non-performing exposures (NPEs) on banks' balance sheets. The stock of non-performing loans (NPLs) in the EU banking sector amounted to EUR 989 billion at the end of 2016, EUR 815 billion at the end of 2017 and EUR 779 billion in the first quarter of 2018, i.e. 5.4%, 4.1% and 3.9% respectively of the total loan portfolio. The EU average NPE ratio was 3.4% in the first quarter of 2018.2",
            "2. The dispersion of the stock of NPEs is uneven across Member States. There are currently 12 Member States experiencing above average NPE ratios, and the scale and the cross-border implications make this an EU-wide problem. The overall level remains high by historic standards, even though the joint efforts of banks, supervisors and macroprudential authorities have led to a slow improvement in NPE ratios over recent years.",
            "3. The EBA's risk analysis, supported by similar research conducted by other international organisations, indicated that high levels of NPEs are a drag on profitability and are strongly correlated with weak lending growth. The effects of high levels of NPEs on banks' balance sheets on, inter alia, funding costs and capital and profitability can seriously jeopardise institutions' ability to run a viable and sustainable business model.",
            "4. NPEs are a problem at multiple levels: at microprudential level, high levels of NPEs are associated with lower profitability and lower efficiency; at macroprudential level, high levels of NPEs are connected with stagnant growth, as capital is tied up in NPEs and there is decreased new lending into the real economy. In addition, high stocks of NPEs negatively affect the resilience of the banking sector to shocks and hence increase systemic risk. Finally, for consumers, an inability to meet the obligations of the credit contract could have a detrimental impact on their financial situation and social circumstances. All of these effects must be tackled in a comprehensive manner.",
            "5. In 2014, in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 on supervisory reporting the EBA introduced definitions of NPEs and forborne exposures (FBEs) to facilitate the identification of problematic assets. Despite the decreasing trend in levels of NPEs in most EU Member States, the pace of reduction of NPLs has been slow. This slow pace of reduction is mainly due to the discretion allowed banks' management and supervisors, together with the absence of an effective secondary market for NPEs and challenging legal systems, which have incentivised credit institutions to keep the loans on their balance sheets."

The level of a 5% gross NPL ratio aims to ensure a minimum level of transparency, and to ensure that credit institutions are prepared to prevent NPEs building up and to take action at an early stage to tackle the issue. The rationale behind applying an NPL threshold is that the majority of exposures on credit institutions' balance sheets that have become non- performing are loans; therefore, a calculation that is based on the share of NPLs better depicts the evolution of asset quality overall and is more risk based.

In particular, financial institutions should comply with the following requirements: a) They must determine the assumed time of disposal taking into account current and expected market conditions as well as the underlying national legal framework regarding the disposal of mortgaged properties. b) They must ensure that the property price used to determine the estimated market value of property collateral at the point of liquidation is not based on macroeconomic projections/assumptions that are more optimistic than the projections produced by the relevant authorities and organisations such as International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European System of Central Banks (ESCB)/ the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), and therefore does not assume an improvement on the current market conditions. 55 FINAL REPORT - GUIDELINES ON MANAGEMENT OF NON-PERFORMING AND FORBORNE EXPOSURES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY c) They must ensure that income from property collateral is not assumed to increase from the current levels unless there is an existing contractual arrangement for such an increase. Moreover, current income from property should be adjusted when calculating cash flow in order to reflect the expected economic conditions. Credit institutions should consider whether it is appropriate to project a flat income in a recessionary environment in which vacant properties are increasing and/or demand for transportation is decreasing, putting downwards pressure on income. d) A hold strategy on property collateral is not acceptable.

Because of this understanding, the level at which downturn LGDs are calibrated should be at least the same as the level at which long-run average LGDs are calculated for the purpose of calibration. In this context, it should be recalled that the GL on PD and LGD estimation define the notion of 'calibration segments' as a uniquely identified subset of the range of application of the LGD model that is jointly calibrated. The use of calibration segments does not, however, require institutions to calibrate LGDs at the level of calibration segments. Institutions may use calibration segments but calibrate LGD estimates at the level of each grade or pool (e.g. if, in the step of calibration, the portfolio under consideration is split by certain regions) within those calibration segments. However, regardless of whether an institution calculates the long- run average LGD at the level of calibration segments or at the level of grades or pools, both with the objective of providing LGD estimates by facility grade or pool, the quantification of downturn LGD estimates should follow the level considered by the institution for the purpose of calibrating LGD estimates to the long-run average LGD.",

The European Banking Authority (EBA) has previously outlined its programme on the review of the IRB approach in the EBA's report and opinion on the implementation of the regulatory review of the IRB approach published in February 2016.1 After (i) reviewing supervisory practices, (ii) harmonising the definition of default and (iii) providing more clarity on how to model probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and defaulted exposures, including the estimation of downturn LGD, the credit risk mitigation (CRM) framework constitutes the fourth and last phase of this programme. Although these guidelines (GL) were not originally envisaged as part of the review, the need for these GL has been identified in the course of work aiming to clarify the CRM framework in the context of the advanced IRB (A-IRB) approach.2 They thereby complement the EBA's report on the credit risk mitigation framework3 (the CRM report), which was focused on the standardised approach (SA) and the foundation IRB (F-IRB) approach.",
            "2. In accordance with Article 108 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (the Capital Requirements Regulation, CRR), for exposures to which an institution applies the SA or F-IRB approach, the institution may use CRM in accordance with Part Three, Title II, Chapter 4 of the CRR (Chapter 4) in the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts (RWEAs). For exposures to which an institution applies the IRB approach with own estimates of LGDs and conversion factors, i.e. exposures under the A-IRB approach, the institution may use CRM in accordance with Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3 of the CRR (Chapter 3). Due to these different requirements for the SA and F-IRB approach on the one hand and for the A-IRB approach on the other hand, the requirements for the use of CRM have to be considered separately."

Therefore, the treatment of rating of third parties is not considered a method for recognising CRM. In particular, the rating transfer of paragraph 62(a) of those guidelines, i.e. the reference to 'appropriate guarantee', reflects support provided by the third party to the obligor and not to the institution itself, as would be the case under the definition of UFCP as a form of CRM technique given in points (57) and (59) of Article 4(1) of the CRR.",
            "12.It should be noted in this context that providing support by a third party to the obligor does not require any action from the lending institution and if it is efficient it may decrease the PD of the obligor. In contrast, CRM is a protection provided for the lending institution and, in accordance with Article 178(1) of the CRR, as further clarified in the EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default, the use of CRM is an indication of default of the obligor."

For exposures to which institutions apply the A-IRB approach, the CRR specifies the eligibility requirements for (i) FCP (other than MNA and OBSN) in Article 181(1)(f) and (ii) UFCP in Article 183(1). In accordance with these provisions the A-IRB institutions are required to ensure that the CRM meets the fundamental elements of the eligibility criteria, while at the same time the hierarchy of the approaches is maintained by allowing a broader range of CRM techniques to be recognised under the A-IRB approach than under the less sophisticated approaches. Under the SA and F-IRB approach, the eligibility requirements of Chapter 4 are very restrictive considering the limitations of the methods for the recognition of CRM. Under the A-IRB approach, the risk sensitivity is enhanced through broader eligibility of CRM techniques provided that institutions can adequately reflect their effects in the LGD estimates."

            "19.While it is important to ensure legal certainty of the CRM techniques, especially when they are recognised in the calculation of own funds requirements, the EBA recognises that assessing legal certainty may be challenging, in particular in cases where the collateral has the form of a movable physical asset. The GL provide principles for institutions on how to achieve a sufficient level of legal certainty while avoiding excessive burden and unjustified costs. In particular, the GL specify a minimum list of jurisdictions that should be considered relevant for a given physical collateral other than immovable property, and for which the legal opinion should be provided. In addition, institutions should consider whether for a given collateral there are also other jurisdictions that should be considered relevant.",
            "20. The list of jurisdictions that should be considered relevant includes the jurisdiction where it is most likely that the realisation of the collateral would be carried out, should this be necessary. While in some cases it may not be easy to foresee the place of realisation of collateral, the choice of this most likely jurisdiction could be based on one of the following considerations: · contractual specification of the location to which the obligor is obliged to move the collateral in the event of non-payment; · legal obligation of the obligor to move the collateral to a location specified by the creditor, stemming from international regulations or conventions; · previous experience with regard to realising collateral of the same type; . in cases such as leasing exposures, where the asset is owned by the institution, the most likely choice of the institution. In some cases, it may be difficult to specify just one jurisdiction where the potential realisation of collateral would take place. In such case, where there are two or more jurisdictions where the realisation of collateral is equally likely, institutions should include jurisdictions considered relevant, as specified in paragraph 23(e) of the GL.",
            "21.It should be noted that the GL do not require a separate legal opinion for each relevant jurisdiction. Where possible, institutions may rely on a single legal opinion covering several jurisdictions. This may be possible in particular in those cases where international regulations have been adopted that provide a robust international framework enforcing creditors' rights over their collateral. Such regulations would typically have a form of an international convention that has been adopted or confirmed by a number of jurisdictions. The assessment based on 11 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT RISK MITIGATION EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY international regulations should therefore include a clear identification of whether these regulations cover all jurisdictions relevant for a given collateral and an assessment of whether they ensure legal effectiveness and enforceability of the collateral, as well as the types of collateral that are subject to the regulations."

Guidance on how FCP other than MNA and OBSN should be recognised in the institutions' LGD estimates has already been provided in the EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation. It is important to highlight that the relevant requirements with respect to the estimation of risk parameters also apply when recognising CRM techniques using own LGD estimates, including that the relevant data must be collected and stored, the estimates must be based on material risk drivers and empirical evidence and not only on judgemental considerations, and the estimates must be validated against the observed loss experience. The burden of proof of adequacy and compliance with these requirements rests on the institutions."

Question 2: Do you agree with the proposed clarifications on the assessment of legal certainty of movable physical collateral? How do you currently perform the assessment of legal effectiveness and enforceability for movable physical collateral? Question 3: Do you agree with the proposed clarification regarding the calculation of realised LGD on exposures covered by eligible on-balance sheet netting or master netting agreements? Question 4: Do you have specific concerns related to the recognition of collateral in the modelling of LGD? How do you currently recognise collateral in your LGD estimates? Question 5: What approaches for the recognition of the unfunded credit protection do you currently use? What challenges would there be in applying approaches listed above for the recognition of unfunded credit protection? Question 6: Do you have any specific concerns related to the issues excluded from the scope of the Guidelines? Question 7: Do you agree with the proposed clarification regarding the parallel treatment of ineligible UFCP and ineligible FCP? How do you currently monitor the cash flows related to ineligible unfunded credit protection and how do you treat such cash flows with regard to the PD and LGD estimates? Question 8: Do you agree with the proposed rules for the application of the substitution approach? Do you see any operational limitations in excluding the guaranteed part of exposure to which substitution approach is applied from the scope of application of the LGD model for unguaranteed exposures? Question 9: Do you agree with the proposed rules for the application of the modelling approach? Question 10: What challenges would you envisage for back-testing the substitution approach? Do you agree that the back-testing should be performed rather at Expected loss level? Do you have any approach currently in place for the back-testing of substitution approach? Question 11: Do you agree with the proposed guidance for the estimation of the LGD of comparable direct exposure towards the guarantor? What concerns would you have about the calculation of the risk weight floor? Question 12: Do you consider portfolio guarantees as a form of eligible UFCP? Do they include cases where the guarantee contract sets a materiality threshold on portfolio losses below or above which no payment shall be made by the guarantor? Do they include cases where two or more thresholds (caps) either expressed in percentages or in currency units are set to limit the maximum obligation 62 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT RISK MITIGATION EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY under the guarantee? How do you recognise the portfolio guarantees' credit risk mitigation effects in adjusting risk parameters? 63 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT RISK MITIGATION EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Feedback on the public consultation The EBA publicly consulted on the draft proposal contained in this paper. The consultation period lasted for 3 months and ended on 25 May 2019. The EBA received 35 responses, of which 25 were published on the EBA website. This paper presents a summary of the key points and other comments arising from the consultation, the analysis and discussion triggered by these comments and the actions taken to address them if deemed necessary. In many cases, several industry bodies made similar comments or the same comments were repeated in the responses to different questions. In such cases, the comments and EBA analysis are included in the section of this paper where the EBA considers them most appropriate. Changes to the draft guidelines have been incorporated as a result of the responses received during the public consultation. Summary of key issues and the EBA's response As the consultation paper included 12 specific questions, the industry provided detailed feedback on the draft GL. There was general support for the GL and in particular for the EBA's efforts to provide clarity on the CRM framework for A-IRB exposures. While the overall number of responses is high, it has to be noted that most of the submitters did not respond to all of the questions and were focused on specific topics such as legal certainty of other physical collateral and the treatment of credit insurance. Only six respondents provided comprehensive feedback on all or most of the questions. Most of the respondents focused on the eligibility requirements of FCP and the assessment of legal certainty (questions 1 and 2). In particular, negative feedback was received on the strict approach proposed for the selection of relevant jurisdictions for other physical collateral (i.e. the set of jurisdictions where the collateral could move during the lifetime of the loan according to the collateral agreement). The alternative approach considered in an explanatory box (where the relevant set of jurisdictions could be limited to those where the collateral is usually located depending on the purpose of its use) was evaluated as unpractical, since many physical types of collateral such as ships or aircrafts do not have a precise set of usual jurisdictions where they operate. Some of the respondents also pointed out the potential cost of having a legal opinion for each jurisdiction. Furthermore, it was also argued that it is not market practice to require assets to be operated or located within a limited number of jurisdictions. Moreover, the respondents brought to the EBA attention a number of international agreements, such as the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment, the Protocol thereto on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment and the Luxembourg Rail Protocol (expected to be in force by the time the GL come into force), which are supposed to provide a robust international framework for the enforcement of creditors' rights over their collateral. The EBA has carefully considered the 64 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT RISK MITIGATION EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY feedback received and adjusted the proposal such that legal certainty could be achieved in a simpler and less costly manner. Several respondents (nine) focused on the treatment of credit insurance, in particular with respect to the final Basel III framework, in which these exposures will be treated under the F-IRB approach. While the comments are mostly in response to questions 6, 8 and 11, they generally appear to go beyond the scope of these GL, contesting the requirements of the CRR and the reforms envisaged with the implementation of the final Basel III framework. A comprehensive response to these concerns was expressed in the EBA's Opinion on the treatment of credit insurance in the prudential framework, published and submitted to the Commission in March 202025. While there was broad agreement with the requirements specified for the back-testing of substitution of risk parameters, some respondents expressed concerns about its legal feasibility. More detailed feedback with regard to these and other comments is provided in the table below."

(c) The rating philosophy should also be taken into account for back testing purposes. Philosophies sensitive to economic conditions tend to estimate PDs that are better predictors of each year's default rates. On the other hand, philosophies less sensitive to economic conditions tend to estimate PDs that are closer to the average PD across the various states of the economy, but that differ from observed default rates in years where the state of the economy is above or below its average. Deviations between observed default rates and the long-run average default rate of the relevant grade will hence be more likely in rating systems less sensitive to economic conditions.

For this purpose institutions should choose a calibration method that is appropriate for their LGD estimation methodology from the following approaches: (a) the calibration of LGD estimates to the long-run average LGD calculated for each grade or pool, in which case they should provide additional calibration tests at the level of the relevant calibration segment; (b) the calibration of LGD estimates to the long-run average LGD calculated at the level of calibration segment, in particular where they use direct LGD estimates in accordance with Article 169(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, including where they use LGD estimation methodology based on intermediate parameters. In this case institutions should at least compare this long-run average LGD with the average LGD estimate applied to the same set of observations as those used for calculating the long-run average LGD and, where necessary, correct the individual LGD estimates for the application portfolio accordingly, for instance by using a scaling factor.
