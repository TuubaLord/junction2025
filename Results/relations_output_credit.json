To fulfil these responsibilities, the management body should instruct senior management to: a. develop and maintain appropriate processes, which should be systematic and consistently applied, to determine appropriate allowances in accordance with the applicable accounting framework; b. establish and implement an effective internal control system for credit risk assessment and measurement; report periodically the results of the credit risk assessment and measurement processes, including estimates of its ECL allowances; c. establish, implement and, as necessary, update suitable policies and procedures to communicate the credit risk assessment and measurement process internally to all relevant staff, in particular staff members who are involved in that process.

The institution's credit risk appetite should specify the scope and focus of the credit risk of the institution, the composition of the credit portfolio, including its concentration, and diversification objectives in relation to business lines, geographies, economic sectors and products.\n\n31. The credit risk appetite should be implemented with the support of appropriate credit risk metrics and limits. These metrics and limits should cover key aspects of the credit risk appetite, as well as client segments, currency, collateral types and credit risk mitigation instruments. When relevant, credit metrics should be a combination of backward-looking and forward- 20 FINAL REPORT - GUIDELINES ON LOAN ORIGINATION AND MONITORING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY looking indicators and should be tailored to the business model and complexity of the institution.\n\n32. Institutions should ensure that the credit risk appetite and associated metrics and limits are appropriately cascaded down within the institution, including all relevant group entities and business lines and units bearing credit risk.\n\n33. For the purposes of managing concentration risk, institutions should set quantitative internal credit risk limits for their aggregate credit risk, as well as portfolios with shared credit risk characteristics, sub-portfolios and individual borrowers.

Recognising that credit institutions may have well-established regulatory capital models for the measurement of expected losses, these models may be used as a starting point for estimating ECL for accounting purposes; however, regulatory capital models may not be directly usable in the measurement of accounting ECL because of differences between the objectives of, and inputs used for, each of these purposes.\n\n12.As with all EBA guidelines, these guidelines should be read holistically with the understanding that the examples provided are not all-inclusive and that a checklist approach to applying these guidelines is not intended. While these guidelines are to be applied for the assessment of credit risk from, and the measurement of ECL on, lending exposures under the applicable accounting framework, they do not set out principles and expectations targeted at specific categories of loans such as corporate, retail and project finance. In this regard, certain aspects of the guidelines may be more applicable to the individual credit assessment of a large corporate borrower, while other aspects may be more relevant to collective assessments of a particular group of retail customers. Objective of the guidelines\n\n13.Building on the BCBS guidance, these guidelines aim at ensuring sound credit risk management practices for credit institutions, associated with the implementation and ongoing application of ECL accounting models. Furthermore, they set out the supervisory expectations for credit institutions related to sound credit risk practices associated with implementing and applying an ECL accounting model.\n\n14.In particular, on the considerations on proportionate application of the EBA guidelines, the EBA notes that all credit institutions applying IFRS 9 should ensure that they meet the objectives of IFRS 9 when applying the standard. However, the EBA understands that the way of meeting these objectives may differ across credit institutions; for example, different techniques or models may be used in the measurement of ECL. Credit institutions should comply with these guidelines in a proportionate manner taking into account various criteria, such as their size and internal organisation and the nature, scope and complexity of their activities and portfolios, as described in paragraph 17 of the guidelines. Credit institutions should, however, take into consideration if using practical expedients that the objective of IFRS 9 is to estimate ECL to reflect an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes (IFRS 9, paragraph 5.5.17)\n\n15. The EBA guidelines would not prevent a credit institution from meeting the impairment requirements of IFRS 9 and the BCBS guidance. Rather, these guidelines should be read as the supervisory approach to support the appropriate application of those standards.\n\n16. These guidelines should be read in conjunction with the provisions of Regulation (EU) 575/2013 and Directive 2013/36/EU regarding internal governance, credit risk, disclosures, supervisory review and evaluation process and requirements, and supervisory measures and powers, as supplemented by the relevant technical standards adopted by the Commission (in particular, the 9 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT INSTITUTIONS' CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND ACCOUNTING FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY implementing technical standards (ITS) on forbearance and non-performing exposures11), and as further developed by guidelines (in particular, the EBA Guidelines on common procedures and methodologies for the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP)12, the EBA Guidelines on internal governance13, and the EBA Guidelines on materiality, proprietary and confidentiality and on disclosure frequency14, among others). 11 See also Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/227 of 9 January 2015 amending Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 laying down implementing technical standards with regard to supervisory reporting of institutions according to Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 41, 20.2.2015, p. 1) which establishes specific definitions of forbearance and non-performing exposures.",

Limits must be established at least for exposures to specific products, certain counterparties, particular industries or economic sectors, individual foreign countries or groups of countries. The utilisation rate of the limits set must be monitored continuously.\n\n(78) Supervised entities must also identify such indirect risk concentrations that may arise in situations where the performance of different business lines react in the same way to external, primarily macroeconomic factors.\n\n(79) If the avoidance of certain risk concentrations is difficult or the concentrations are justifiable from a business point of view, the increased credit risk thus arising shall be considered in the pricing and calculation of capital adequacy.",

Moreover, current income from property should be adjusted when calculating cash flow in order to reflect the expected economic conditions. Credit institutions should consider whether it is appropriate to project a flat income in a recessionary environment in which vacant properties are increasing and/or demand for transportation is decreasing, putting downwards pressure on income. d) A hold strategy on property collateral is not acceptable. A hold strategy is defined as holding the asset at above market value assuming that the asset will be sold after the market recovers.\n\n222.

When the observable market price is used to assess the recoverable amount of the exposure, the amount, source and date of the observable market price should also be documented.\n\n224. Credit institutions should be able to substantiate the assumptions used when assessing the recoverable amount by providing to the competent authority, if requested, details on the property market value, the market price discount, legal and selling expenses applied, and the term used for the time to liquidation.

When interest-only loans are advanced for CRE, institutions should assess property cash flow to support a level of amortisation equivalent to the projected economic life cycle of the property, to clear the principal amount and interest of the loan in the event of an increase in the loan to value (LTV) for the property, or to a regular LTV level in the relevant market. Institutions should also consider such analysis when borrowers have additional credit enhancements, e.g. disposal assets that are legally enforceable in a reasonable time period.\n\n174. For the purposes of the sensitivity analysis under adverse market and idiosyncratic events, institutions should, in addition to the events specified in Section 5.2.5 and Section 5.2.6, take into account the following, as applicable: a. reletting, including a change in the rental prices, lease length in relation to loan term service charges, an increase in vacancy rates, maintenance and refurbishment costs, rent-free periods and letting inducement; b. risks and delays associated with refinancing; C. capital expenditure risk; d. other relevant criteria. 46 FINAL REPORT - GUIDELINES ON LOAN ORIGINATION AND MONITORING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY",

In addition, credit institutions should pay attention to the requirements for valuing cash flow under IFRS 13 on fair value measurements. In particular, financial institutions should comply with the following requirements: a) They must determine the assumed time of disposal taking into account current and expected market conditions as well as the underlying national legal framework regarding the disposal of mortgaged properties. b) They must ensure that the property price used to determine the estimated market value of property collateral at the point of liquidation is not based on macroeconomic projections/assumptions that are more optimistic than the projections produced by the relevant authorities and organisations such as International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European System of Central Banks (ESCB)/ the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), and therefore does not assume an improvement on the current market conditions. 55 FINAL REPORT - GUIDELINES ON MANAGEMENT OF NON-PERFORMING AND FORBORNE EXPOSURES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY c) They must ensure that income from property collateral is not assumed to increase from the current levels unless there is an existing contractual arrangement for such an increase. Moreover, current income from property should be adjusted when calculating cash flow in order to reflect the expected economic conditions. Credit institutions should consider whether it is appropriate to project a flat income in a recessionary environment in which vacant properties are increasing and/or demand for transportation is decreasing, putting downwards pressure on income. d) A hold strategy on property collateral is not acceptable. A hold strategy is defined as holding the asset at above market value assuming that the asset will be sold after the market recovers.\n\n222. When using the value of collateral in assessing the recoverable amount of the exposure, at least the following should be documented: a) how the value was determined, including the use of appraisals, valuation assumptions and calculations; b) the supporting rationale for adjustments to appraised values, if any; c) the determination of selling costs, if applicable; d) the assumed timeline to recover; e) the expertise and independence of the appraiser.\n\n223. When the observable market price is used to assess the recoverable amount of the exposure, the amount, source and date of the observable market price should also be documented.\n\n224. Credit institutions should be able to substantiate the assumptions used when assessing the recoverable amount by providing to the competent authority, if requested, details on the property market value, the market price discount, legal and selling expenses applied, and the term used for the time to liquidation.

    "paragraph_b_text": "68. Credit institutions should have the necessary tools to ensure a robust estimate and timely recognition of ECL. Given that information on historical loss experience or the impact of current conditions may not fully reflect the credit risk in lending exposures, credit institutions should use their experienced credit judgement to thoroughly incorporate the expected impact of all reasonable and supportable forward-looking information, including macroeconomic factors, on its estimate of ECL. A credit institution's use of its experienced credit judgement should be documented in the credit institution's credit risk methodology and subject to appropriate oversight.\n\n69. Historical information provides a useful basis for the identification of trends and correlations needed to identify the credit risk drivers for lending exposures. However, ECL estimates must not ignore the impact of (forward-looking) events and conditions on those drivers. The estimate should reflect the expected future cash shortfalls resulting from such impact.\n\n70. Consideration of forward-looking information should not be avoided on the basis that a credit institution considers the cost of incorporating such forward-looking information to be very high or unnecessary or because there is uncertainty in formulating forward-looking scenarios, unless the additional cost and operational burden to be introduced do not contribute to a high-quality implementation of an ECL accounting framework.\n\n71. Credit institutions should be able to demonstrate that the forward-looking information factored into the ECL estimation process has a link to the credit risk drivers for particular exposures or portfolios. Given that it may not be possible to demonstrate a strong link in formal statistical terms between certain types of information, or even the information set as a whole, and the credit risk drivers, credit institutions should use their experienced credit judgement in establishing an appropriate level for the individual or collective allowance. When a forward-looking factor that has been identified as relevant is not incorporated into the individual or collective assessment, temporary adjustments may be necessary. 33 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT INSTITUTIONS' CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND ACCOUNTING FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY\n\n72. Macroeconomic forecasts and other relevant information should be applied consistently across portfolios where the credit risk drivers of the portfolios are affected by these forecasts/assumptions in the same way. Furthermore, when developing ECL estimates, credit institutions should apply their experienced credit judgement to consider their point in the credit cycle, which may differ across the jurisdictions in which they have lending exposures.\n\n73. Credit institutions should exercise care when determining the level of ECL allowances to be recognised for accounting purposes, to ensure that the resulting estimates are appropriate (i.e. consistent with neutrality and neither understated nor overstated).\n\n74. Additionally, credit institutions should avail themselves of a wide range of information derived in the credit risk management process, including that of a forward-looking nature for risk management and capital adequacy purposes, in developing their estimate of ECL.",

    "paragraph_b_text": "91. In formulating the estimate of the amount equal to 12-month ECL, credit institutions should consider reasonable and supportable information, as referred to in the Definitions and in Principle 6 of these guidelines, that affect credit risk, especially forward-looking information, including macroeconomic factors. Credit institutions should exercise experienced credit judgement to consider both qualitative and quantitative information that may affect the credit institution's assessment of credit risk. IFRS 9 provides that an entity does not need to undertake an exhaustive search for information when measuring an amount equal to 12- month ECL. However, credit institutions should actively incorporate information that may affect the estimate of ECL, and credit institutions should not exclude or ignore relevant information that is reasonably available.\n\n92. Where a credit institution originates high-credit-risk exposures (which should not be understood, in the context of this paragraph, as meaning the opposite of 'low credit risk' exposures as described by IFRS 9, paragraph 5.5.10) and their allowances are initially measured at 12-month ECL, the credit institution should monitor these exposures closely for significant increases in credit risk to ensure a timely movement of the exposure to lifetime ECL measurement, in order to take into account that high risk exposures are likely to exhibit greater volatility and to experience a more rapid increase in credit risk.\n\n93. Even if an increase in credit risk is not judged to be significant, a credit institution should adjust its estimate of 12-month ECL to appropriately reflect changes in credit risk that have taken place. Such adjustments should be made well before exposures move, either individually or collectively, to lifetime ECL measurement and taking into account any migration of credit risk which has taken place.\n\n94. Where a collective assessment is performed, exposures within that group should adhere to the requirements set out in Principle 3 of these guidelines. In particular, where information becomes available to the credit institution indicating that further or different segmentation within a group of lending exposures is required, the group should be split into subgroups and the measurement of the amount equal to 12-month ECL should be updated separately for each subgroup or, in the case of transient circumstances, a temporary adjustment should be applied (see Principle 3 of these guidelines and its detailed requirements on the use of temporary adjustments). Where information becomes available which indicates that a particular subgroup has suffered a significant increase in credit risk, then lifetime ECL should be recognised in respect of that subgroup.\n\n95. Lending exposures should not be grouped in such a way as to obscure the identification of significant increases in credit risk on a timely basis (see also Principles 3 and 4 of these guidelines for additional requirements regarding grouping and collective assessments of ECL).",

Competent authorities should also evaluate whether the credit institution's processes and controls separately identify ECL allowance estimates related to exposures consistent with the credit institution's risk appetite and those related to riskier lending exposures; d. appropriate information about the credit risk of lending exposures, changes in credit risk, the related ECL allowance and changes in allowance estimates is provided to the credit institution's management body and senior management on a regular (for example, quarterly or, if warranted, more frequent) basis; e. forecasts included in credit risk assessments and measurements are not only reasonable and supportable, but are also consistent with forecasts used for other purposes by the credit institution, all of which are made available to competent authorities; and 49 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT INSTITUTIONS' CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND ACCOUNTING FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY f. the credit institution's policies and procedures for validating the accuracy and consistency of its internal credit risk assessment models are robust.\n\n140.

However, these guidelines extend the scope of the assessment beyond those minimum requirements to allow competent authorities to form a comprehensive view on risks to capital.\n\n162. When evaluating risks to capital, competent authorities should also consider the potential impact of funding cost risk following the methodology included in Title 8 and may decide on the necessity of measures to mitigate this risk.\n\n163. In their implementation of the methodologies specified in this title, competent authorities should identify relevant quantitative indicators and other metrics, which could also be used to monitor key indicators, as specified in Title 3.\n\n164.

For such purposes, peers should be defined on a risk-by-risk basis and might differ from those identified for BMA or other analyses.\n\n167. . In the assessment of risks to capital, competent authorities should also evaluate the accuracy and prudency of the calculation of minimum own fund requirements to identify situations where minimum own funds calculations may underestimate the actual level of risk.

Combating money laundering and terrorist financing is essential for maintaining stability and integrity in the financial system. Uncovering involvement of an institution in money laundering and terrorist financing might have an impact on its viability and the trust in the financial system. Together with the authorities and bodies (e.g. AML supervisors and financial intelligence units) responsible for ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering rules under Directive (EU) 2015/849, competent authorities have an important role to play in identifying and tackling weaknesses. In this context, the guidelines clarify in line with Directive 2013/36/EU that identifying, managing and mitigating money laundering and financing of terrorism risk is part of sound internal governance arrangements and credit institutions' risk management framework.\n\n20.

In addition, it is also necessary to take into account developments in this area since the publication of the revised EBA guidelines on internal governance in 2017, such as the updated OECD principles of corporate governance4 and the revised corporate governance principles for banks published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)5. The guidelines align the terminology used regarding risk appetite and risk tolerance with the EBA guidelines on common procedures and methodologies for the SREP and also with the revised BCBS principles; they use the term 'risk appetite' to refer to the aggregate level of risk and the types",

Given that information on historical loss experience or the impact of current conditions may not fully reflect the credit risk in lending exposures, credit institutions should use their experienced credit judgement to thoroughly incorporate the expected impact of all reasonable and supportable forward-looking information, including macroeconomic factors, on its estimate of ECL. A credit institution's use of its experienced credit judgement should be documented in the credit institution's credit risk methodology and subject to appropriate oversight.\n\n69. Historical information provides a useful basis for the identification of trends and correlations needed to identify the credit risk drivers for lending exposures. However, ECL estimates must not ignore the impact of (forward-looking) events and conditions on those drivers. The estimate should reflect the expected future cash shortfalls resulting from such impact.\n\n70. Consideration of forward-looking information should not be avoided on the basis that a credit institution considers the cost of incorporating such forward-looking information to be very high or unnecessary or because there is uncertainty in formulating forward-looking scenarios, unless the additional cost and operational burden to be introduced do not contribute to a high-quality implementation of an ECL accounting framework.\n\n71. Credit institutions should be able to demonstrate that the forward-looking information factored into the ECL estimation process has a link to the credit risk drivers for particular exposures or portfolios. Given that it may not be possible to demonstrate a strong link in formal statistical terms between certain types of information, or even the information set as a whole, and the credit risk drivers, credit institutions should use their experienced credit judgement in establishing an appropriate level for the individual or collective allowance.

Furthermore, when developing ECL estimates, credit institutions should apply their experienced credit judgement to consider their point in the credit cycle, which may differ across the jurisdictions in which they have lending exposures.\n\n73. Credit institutions should exercise care when determining the level of ECL allowances to be recognised for accounting purposes, to ensure that the resulting estimates are appropriate (i.e. consistent with neutrality and neither understated nor overstated).\n\n74.

Credit institutions should exercise experienced credit judgement to consider both qualitative and quantitative information that may affect the credit institution's assessment of credit risk. IFRS 9 provides that an entity does not need to undertake an exhaustive search for information when measuring an amount equal to 12- month ECL. However, credit institutions should actively incorporate information that may affect the estimate of ECL, and credit institutions should not exclude or ignore relevant information that is reasonably available.\n\n92. Where a credit institution originates high-credit-risk exposures (which should not be understood, in the context of this paragraph, as meaning the opposite of 'low credit risk' exposures as described by IFRS 9, paragraph 5.5.10) and their allowances are initially measured at 12-month ECL, the credit institution should monitor these exposures closely for significant increases in credit risk to ensure a timely movement of the exposure to lifetime ECL measurement, in order to take into account that high risk exposures are likely to exhibit greater volatility and to experience a more rapid increase in credit risk.\n\n93. Even if an increase in credit risk is not judged to be significant, a credit institution should adjust its estimate of 12-month ECL to appropriately reflect changes in credit risk that have taken place. Such adjustments should be made well before exposures move, either individually or collectively, to lifetime ECL measurement and taking into account any migration of credit risk which has taken place.\n\n94. Where a collective assessment is performed, exposures within that group should adhere to the requirements set out in Principle 3 of these guidelines. In particular, where information becomes available to the credit institution indicating that further or different segmentation within a group of lending exposures is required, the group should be split into subgroups and the measurement of the amount equal to 12-month ECL should be updated separately for each subgroup or, in the case of transient circumstances, a temporary adjustment should be applied (see Principle 3 of these guidelines and its detailed requirements on the use of temporary adjustments). Where information becomes available which indicates that a particular subgroup has suffered a significant increase in credit risk, then lifetime ECL should be recognised in respect of that subgroup.\n\n95.

In formulating the estimate of the amount equal to 12-month ECL, credit institutions should consider reasonable and supportable information, as referred to in the Definitions and in Principle 6 of these guidelines, that affect credit risk, especially forward-looking information, including macroeconomic factors. Credit institutions should exercise experienced credit judgement to consider both qualitative and quantitative information that may affect the credit institution's assessment of credit risk. IFRS 9 provides that an entity does not need to undertake an exhaustive search for information when measuring an amount equal to 12- month ECL. However, credit institutions should actively incorporate information that may affect the estimate of ECL, and credit institutions should not exclude or ignore relevant information that is reasonably available.\n\n92. Where a credit institution originates high-credit-risk exposures (which should not be understood, in the context of this paragraph, as meaning the opposite of 'low credit risk' exposures as described by IFRS 9, paragraph 5.5.10) and their allowances are initially measured at 12-month ECL, the credit institution should monitor these exposures closely for significant increases in credit risk to ensure a timely movement of the exposure to lifetime ECL measurement, in order to take into account that high risk exposures are likely to exhibit greater volatility and to experience a more rapid increase in credit risk.\n\n93. Even if an increase in credit risk is not judged to be significant, a credit institution should adjust its estimate of 12-month ECL to appropriately reflect changes in credit risk that have taken place. Such adjustments should be made well before exposures move, either individually or collectively, to lifetime ECL measurement and taking into account any migration of credit risk which has taken place.\n\n94.

In particular, where information becomes available to the credit institution indicating that further or different segmentation within a group of lending exposures is required, the group should be split into subgroups and the measurement of the amount equal to 12-month ECL should be updated separately for each subgroup or, in the case of transient circumstances, a temporary adjustment should be applied (see Principle 3 of these guidelines and its detailed requirements on the use of temporary adjustments).

In formulating the estimate of the amount equal to 12-month ECL, credit institutions should consider reasonable and supportable information, as referred to in the Definitions and in Principle 6 of these guidelines, that affect credit risk, especially forward-looking information, including macroeconomic factors. Credit institutions should exercise experienced credit judgement to consider both qualitative and quantitative information that may affect the credit institution's assessment of credit risk. IFRS 9 provides that an entity does not need to undertake an exhaustive search for information when measuring an amount equal to 12- month ECL. However, credit institutions should actively incorporate information that may affect the estimate of ECL, and credit institutions should not exclude or ignore relevant information that is reasonably available.\n\n92. Where a credit institution originates high-credit-risk exposures (which should not be understood, in the context of this paragraph, as meaning the opposite of 'low credit risk' exposures as described by IFRS 9, paragraph 5.5.10) and their allowances are initially measured at 12-month ECL, the credit institution should monitor these exposures closely for significant increases in credit risk to ensure a timely movement of the exposure to lifetime ECL measurement, in order to take into account that high risk exposures are likely to exhibit greater volatility and to experience a more rapid increase in credit risk.\n\n93. Even if an increase in credit risk is not judged to be significant, a credit institution should adjust its estimate of 12-month ECL to appropriately reflect changes in credit risk that have taken place. Such adjustments should be made well before exposures move, either individually or collectively, to lifetime ECL measurement and taking into account any migration of credit risk which has taken place.\n\n94. Where a collective assessment is performed, exposures within that group should adhere to the requirements set out in Principle 3 of these guidelines. In particular, where information becomes available to the credit institution indicating that further or different segmentation within a group of lending exposures is required, the group should be split into subgroups and the measurement of the amount equal to 12-month ECL should be updated separately for each subgroup or, in the case of transient circumstances, a temporary adjustment should be applied (see Principle 3 of these guidelines and its detailed requirements on the use of temporary adjustments). Where information becomes available which indicates that a particular subgroup has suffered a significant increase in credit risk, then lifetime ECL should be recognised in respect of that subgroup.\n\n95. Lending exposures should not be grouped in such a way as to obscure the identification of significant increases in credit risk on a timely basis (see also Principles 3 and 4 of these guidelines for additional requirements regarding grouping and collective assessments of ECL).",

However, these guidelines extend the scope of the assessment beyond those minimum requirements to allow competent authorities to form a comprehensive view on risks to capital.\n\n162. When evaluating risks to capital, competent authorities should also consider the potential impact of funding cost risk following the methodology included in Title 8 and may decide on the necessity of measures to mitigate this risk.\n\n163. In their implementation of the methodologies specified in this title, competent authorities should identify relevant quantitative indicators and other metrics, which could also be used to monitor key indicators, as specified in Title 3.\n\n164.

For such purposes, peers should be defined on a risk-by-risk basis and might differ from those identified for BMA or other analyses.\n\n167. . In the assessment of risks to capital, competent authorities should also evaluate the accuracy and prudency of the calculation of minimum own fund requirements to identify situations where minimum own funds calculations may underestimate the actual level of risk. This assessment would inform the determination of additional own funds requirements as provided in Section 7.2.3.\n\n168.

Combating money laundering and terrorist financing is essential for maintaining stability and integrity in the financial system. Uncovering involvement of an institution in money laundering and terrorist financing might have an impact on its viability and the trust in the financial system. Together with the authorities and bodies (e.g. AML supervisors and financial intelligence units) responsible for ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering rules under Directive (EU) 2015/849, competent authorities have an important role to play in identifying and tackling weaknesses. In this context, the guidelines clarify in line with Directive 2013/36/EU that identifying, managing and mitigating money laundering and financing of terrorism risk is part of sound internal governance arrangements and credit institutions' risk management framework.\n\n20.

In formulating the estimate of the amount equal to 12-month ECL, credit institutions should consider reasonable and supportable information, as referred to in the Definitions and in Principle 6 of these guidelines, that affect credit risk, especially forward-looking information, including macroeconomic factors. Credit institutions should exercise experienced credit judgement to consider both qualitative and quantitative information that may affect the credit institution's assessment of credit risk. IFRS 9 provides that an entity does not need to undertake an exhaustive search for information when measuring an amount equal to 12- month ECL. However, credit institutions should actively incorporate information that may affect the estimate of ECL, and credit institutions should not exclude or ignore relevant information that is reasonably available.\n\n92. Where a credit institution originates high-credit-risk exposures (which should not be understood, in the context of this paragraph, as meaning the opposite of 'low credit risk' exposures as described by IFRS 9, paragraph 5.5.10) and their allowances are initially measured at 12-month ECL, the credit institution should monitor these exposures closely for significant increases in credit risk to ensure a timely movement of the exposure to lifetime ECL measurement, in order to take into account that high risk exposures are likely to exhibit greater volatility and to experience a more rapid increase in credit risk.\n\n93. Even if an increase in credit risk is not judged to be significant, a credit institution should adjust its estimate of 12-month ECL to appropriately reflect changes in credit risk that have taken place. Such adjustments should be made well before exposures move, either individually or collectively, to lifetime ECL measurement and taking into account any migration of credit risk which has taken place.\n\n94. Where a collective assessment is performed, exposures within that group should adhere to the requirements set out in Principle 3 of these guidelines. In particular, where information becomes available to the credit institution indicating that further or different segmentation within a group of lending exposures is required, the group should be split into subgroups and the measurement of the amount equal to 12-month ECL should be updated separately for each subgroup or, in the case of transient circumstances, a temporary adjustment should be applied (see Principle 3 of these guidelines and its detailed requirements on the use of temporary adjustments).

However, these guidelines extend the scope of the assessment beyond those minimum requirements to allow competent authorities to form a comprehensive view on risks to capital.\n\n162. When evaluating risks to capital, competent authorities should also consider the potential impact of funding cost risk following the methodology included in Title 8 and may decide on the necessity of measures to mitigate this risk.\n\n163. In their implementation of the methodologies specified in this title, competent authorities should identify relevant quantitative indicators and other metrics, which could also be used to monitor key indicators, as specified in Title 3.\n\n164.

For such purposes, peers should be defined on a risk-by-risk basis and might differ from those identified for BMA or other analyses.\n\n167. . In the assessment of risks to capital, competent authorities should also evaluate the accuracy and prudency of the calculation of minimum own fund requirements to identify situations where minimum own funds calculations may underestimate the actual level of risk. This assessment would inform the determination of additional own funds requirements as provided in Section 7.2.3.\n\n168. The outcome of the assessment of each material risk should be reflected in a summary of findings that provides an explanation of the main risk drivers, and a risk score, as specified in the following sections.",

When calculating the present value, payments of loan receivables included in the cover pool shall be taken into account in the proportion in which these loan receivables are included in the calculation of the cover pool total value as referred to in section 23 above. If the calculation method based on present value produces a higher cover pool total value than the method based on the nominal value of obligations incurred from the covered bonds, the overcollateralisation shall be determined on the basis of the nominal value. In calculations based on both the current and the nominal value, any increased credit loss risk of the secured receivable shall be appropriately accounted for, at least in cases where the receivable shall, pursuant to Article 178 of the EU Capital Requirements Regulation, be considered non-performing. In calculations based on the nominal value, the cover assets in the cover pool and the impact of currency derivatives contracts shall be taken into account when determining the obligations incurred from covered bonds. In calculations based on the present value, the value of derivatives contracts shall be determined on the basis of present value at the time of valuation. The same method shall be used to determine both the total value of the cover pool and the obligations incurred from the covered bonds. The Financial Supervisory Authority may issue further regulations on the valuation of derivatives and taking total cash flows into account when calculating cover pool total value. The Financial Supervisory Authority may also issue further regulations on the methods used to calculate and value overcollateralisation.

    "paragraph_b_text": "91. In formulating the estimate of the amount equal to 12-month ECL, credit institutions should consider reasonable and supportable information, as referred to in the Definitions and in Principle 6 of these guidelines, that affect credit risk, especially forward-looking information, including macroeconomic factors. Credit institutions should exercise experienced credit judgement to consider both qualitative and quantitative information that may affect the credit institution's assessment of credit risk. IFRS 9 provides that an entity does not need to undertake an exhaustive search for information when measuring an amount equal to 12- month ECL. However, credit institutions should actively incorporate information that may affect the estimate of ECL, and credit institutions should not exclude or ignore relevant information that is reasonably available.\n\n92. Where a credit institution originates high-credit-risk exposures (which should not be understood, in the context of this paragraph, as meaning the opposite of 'low credit risk' exposures as described by IFRS 9, paragraph 5.5.10) and their allowances are initially measured at 12-month ECL, the credit institution should monitor these exposures closely for significant increases in credit risk to ensure a timely movement of the exposure to lifetime ECL measurement, in order to take into account that high risk exposures are likely to exhibit greater volatility and to experience a more rapid increase in credit risk.\n\n93. Even if an increase in credit risk is not judged to be significant, a credit institution should adjust its estimate of 12-month ECL to appropriately reflect changes in credit risk that have taken place. Such adjustments should be made well before exposures move, either individually or collectively, to lifetime ECL measurement and taking into account any migration of credit risk which has taken place.\n\n94. Where a collective assessment is performed, exposures within that group should adhere to the requirements set out in Principle 3 of these guidelines. In particular, where information becomes available to the credit institution indicating that further or different segmentation within a group of lending exposures is required, the group should be split into subgroups and the measurement of the amount equal to 12-month ECL should be updated separately for each subgroup or, in the case of transient circumstances, a temporary adjustment should be applied (see Principle 3 of these guidelines and its detailed requirements on the use of temporary adjustments). Where information becomes available which indicates that a particular subgroup has suffered a significant increase in credit risk, then lifetime ECL should be recognised in respect of that subgroup.\n\n95. Lending exposures should not be grouped in such a way as to obscure the identification of significant increases in credit risk on a timely basis (see also Principles 3 and 4 of these guidelines for additional requirements regarding grouping and collective assessments of ECL).",

The above elements should also be taken into account by competent authorities when they are planning the intensity of their supervisory activity in relation to the assessment of a specific risk.\n\n161. For credit, market and operational risk, competent authorities should verify the institution's compliance with the minimum requirements specified in the relevant EU and national implementing legislation. However, these guidelines extend the scope of the assessment beyond those minimum requirements to allow competent authorities to form a comprehensive view on risks to capital.\n\n162. When evaluating risks to capital, competent authorities should also consider the potential impact of funding cost risk following the methodology included in Title 8 and may decide on the necessity of measures to mitigate this risk.\n\n163. In their implementation of the methodologies specified in this title, competent authorities should identify relevant quantitative indicators and other metrics, which could also be used to monitor key indicators, as specified in Title 3.\n\n164. For each material risk, competent authorities should assess and reflect in the risk score: a. inherent risk (risk exposures); and b. the quality and effectiveness of risk management and controls.\n\n165.

Assessment workflow for risks to capital Assessment of inherent individual risks Assessment of individual risks and controls Inherent risk assessment Risk score Assessment of risks management and controls Risk management and controls assessment\n\n166. When performing their assessments, competent authorities should use all available information sources, including regulatory reporting, ad hoc reporting agreed with the institution, the institution's internal metrics and reports (e.g. internal audit report, risk management reports, information from the ICAAP), on-site inspection reports and external reports (e.g. the institution's communications to investors, rating agencies). While the assessment is intended to be institution-specific, comparison with peers should be considered to identify potential exposure to risks to capital. For such purposes, peers should be defined on a risk-by-risk basis and might differ from those identified for BMA or other analyses.\n\n167. . In the assessment of risks to capital, competent authorities should also evaluate the accuracy and prudency of the calculation of minimum own fund requirements to identify situations where minimum own funds calculations may underestimate the actual level of risk. This assessment would inform the determination of additional own funds requirements as provided in Section 7.2.3.\n\n168. The outcome of the assessment of each material risk should be reflected in a summary of findings that provides an explanation of the main risk drivers, and a risk score, as specified in the following sections.",

Combating money laundering and terrorist financing is essential for maintaining stability and integrity in the financial system. Uncovering involvement of an institution in money laundering and terrorist financing might have an impact on its viability and the trust in the financial system. Together with the authorities and bodies (e.g. AML supervisors and financial intelligence units) responsible for ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering rules under Directive (EU) 2015/849, competent authorities have an important role to play in identifying and tackling weaknesses. In this context, the guidelines clarify in line with Directive 2013/36/EU that identifying, managing and mitigating money laundering and financing of terrorism risk is part of sound internal governance arrangements and credit institutions' risk management framework.\n\n20. In the same way institutions should take into account environmental, social and governance (ESG) risk factors within their risk management framework.\n\n21. Directive 2013/36/EU sets out requirements aimed at remedying weaknesses that were identified during the financial crisis regarding internal governance arrangements and in particular the sound management and oversight of risks. Identified weaknesses included in particular a lack of effective oversight by the managementbody, in particular in its supervisory function, limited accessibility of the supervisory function and shortcomings regarding the authority, stature and resources of the risk management function.\n\n22. In addition, it is also necessary to take into account developments in this area since the publication of the revised EBA guidelines on internal governance in 2017, such as the updated OECD principles of corporate governance4 and the revised corporate governance principles for banks published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)5. The guidelines align the terminology used regarding risk appetite and risk tolerance with the EBA guidelines on common procedures and methodologies for the SREP and also with the revised BCBS principles; they use the term 'risk appetite' to refer to the aggregate level of risk and the types",

In formulating the estimate of the amount equal to 12-month ECL, credit institutions should consider reasonable and supportable information, as referred to in the Definitions and in Principle 6 of these guidelines, that affect credit risk, especially forward-looking information, including macroeconomic factors. Credit institutions should exercise experienced credit judgement to consider both qualitative and quantitative information that may affect the credit institution's assessment of credit risk. IFRS 9 provides that an entity does not need to undertake an exhaustive search for information when measuring an amount equal to 12- month ECL. However, credit institutions should actively incorporate information that may affect the estimate of ECL, and credit institutions should not exclude or ignore relevant information that is reasonably available.\n\n92. Where a credit institution originates high-credit-risk exposures (which should not be understood, in the context of this paragraph, as meaning the opposite of 'low credit risk' exposures as described by IFRS 9, paragraph 5.5.10) and their allowances are initially measured at 12-month ECL, the credit institution should monitor these exposures closely for significant increases in credit risk to ensure a timely movement of the exposure to lifetime ECL measurement, in order to take into account that high risk exposures are likely to exhibit greater volatility and to experience a more rapid increase in credit risk.\n\n93. Even if an increase in credit risk is not judged to be significant, a credit institution should adjust its estimate of 12-month ECL to appropriately reflect changes in credit risk that have taken place. Such adjustments should be made well before exposures move, either individually or collectively, to lifetime ECL measurement and taking into account any migration of credit risk which has taken place.\n\n94. Where a collective assessment is performed, exposures within that group should adhere to the requirements set out in Principle 3 of these guidelines. In particular, where information becomes available to the credit institution indicating that further or different segmentation within a group of lending exposures is required, the group should be split into subgroups and the measurement of the amount equal to 12-month ECL should be updated separately for each subgroup or, in the case of transient circumstances, a temporary adjustment should be applied (see Principle 3 of these guidelines and its detailed requirements on the use of temporary adjustments). Where information becomes available which indicates that a particular subgroup has suffered a significant increase in credit risk, then lifetime ECL should be recognised in respect of that subgroup.\n\n95.

However, these guidelines extend the scope of the assessment beyond those minimum requirements to allow competent authorities to form a comprehensive view on risks to capital.\n\n162. When evaluating risks to capital, competent authorities should also consider the potential impact of funding cost risk following the methodology included in Title 8 and may decide on the necessity of measures to mitigate this risk.\n\n163. In their implementation of the methodologies specified in this title, competent authorities should identify relevant quantitative indicators and other metrics, which could also be used to monitor key indicators, as specified in Title 3.\n\n164.

In the assessment of risks to capital, competent authorities should also evaluate the accuracy and prudency of the calculation of minimum own fund requirements to identify situations where minimum own funds calculations may underestimate the actual level of risk.

However, these guidelines extend the scope of the assessment beyond those minimum requirements to allow competent authorities to form a comprehensive view on risks to capital.\n\n162. When evaluating risks to capital, competent authorities should also consider the potential impact of funding cost risk following the methodology included in Title 8 and may decide on the necessity of measures to mitigate this risk.\n\n163. In their implementation of the methodologies specified in this title, competent authorities should identify relevant quantitative indicators and other metrics, which could also be used to monitor key indicators, as specified in Title 3.\n\n164.

For such purposes, peers should be defined on a risk-by-risk basis and might differ from those identified for BMA or other analyses.\n\n167. . In the assessment of risks to capital, competent authorities should also evaluate the accuracy and prudency of the calculation of minimum own fund requirements to identify situations where minimum own funds calculations may underestimate the actual level of risk. This assessment would inform the determination of additional own funds requirements as provided in Section 7.2.3.\n\n168.

Combating money laundering and terrorist financing is essential for maintaining stability and integrity in the financial system.

Together with the authorities and bodies (e.g. AML supervisors and financial intelligence units) responsible for ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering rules under Directive (EU) 2015/849, competent authorities have an important role to play in identifying and tackling weaknesses. In this context, the guidelines clarify in line with Directive 2013/36/EU that identifying, managing and mitigating money laundering and financing of terrorism risk is part of sound internal governance arrangements and credit institutions' risk management framework.\n\n20.

In addition, it is also necessary to take into account developments in this area since the publication of the revised EBA guidelines on internal governance in 2017, such as the updated OECD principles of corporate governance4 and the revised corporate governance principles for banks published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)5. The guidelines align the terminology used regarding risk appetite and risk tolerance with the EBA guidelines on common procedures and methodologies for the SREP and also with the revised BCBS principles; they use the term 'risk appetite' to refer to the aggregate level of risk and the types",

Internal governance includes all standards and principles concerned with setting an institution's objectives, strategies and risk management framework; how its business is organised; how responsibilities and authority are defined and clearly allocated; how reporting lines are set up and what information they convey; and how the internal control framework is organised and implemented, including accounting procedures and remuneration policies. Internal governance also encompasses sound information technology systems, outsourcing arrangements and business continuity management.\n\n19. Combating money laundering and terrorist financing is essential for maintaining stability and integrity in the financial system. Uncovering involvement of an institution in money laundering and terrorist financing might have an impact on its viability and the trust in the financial system. Together with the authorities and bodies (e.g. AML supervisors and financial intelligence units) responsible for ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering rules under Directive (EU) 2015/849, competent authorities have an important role to play in identifying and tackling weaknesses. In this context, the guidelines clarify in line with Directive 2013/36/EU that identifying, managing and mitigating money laundering and financing of terrorism risk is part of sound internal governance arrangements and credit institutions' risk management framework.\n\n20. In the same way institutions should take into account environmental, social and governance (ESG) risk factors within their risk management framework.\n\n21. Directive 2013/36/EU sets out requirements aimed at remedying weaknesses that were identified during the financial crisis regarding internal governance arrangements and in particular the sound management and oversight of risks. Identified weaknesses included in particular a lack of effective oversight by the managementbody, in particular in its supervisory function, limited accessibility of the supervisory function and shortcomings regarding the authority, stature and resources of the risk management function.\n\n22. In addition, it is also necessary to take into account developments in this area since the publication of the revised EBA guidelines on internal governance in 2017, such as the updated OECD principles of corporate governance4 and the revised corporate governance principles for banks published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)5. The guidelines align the terminology used regarding risk appetite and risk tolerance with the EBA guidelines on common procedures and methodologies for the SREP and also with the revised BCBS principles; they use the term 'risk appetite' to refer to the aggregate level of risk and the types",

This separation of duties approach should encompass not only client relationship activities (e.g. negotiation of forbearance solutions with clients) but also the decision-making process. In this context, credit institutions should consider implementing dedicated decision- making bodies related to NPE workout (e.g. an NPE committee).\n\n64.

When designing an appropriate NPE WU structure, credit institutions should take into account the specificities of their main NPE portfolios, including the type of exposure (retail, SME, corporate) and the type of collateral.\n\n67.Credit institutions should consider designing automated processes for NPE WUs for homogeneous retail NPE portfolios. For corporate NPE portfolios, where relevant, and depending on the sectoral concentration of the NPEs, credit institutions should consider a relationship management approach with sectoral specialisation of NPE WU staff.

For credit, market and operational risk, competent authorities should verify the institution's compliance with the minimum requirements specified in the relevant EU and national implementing legislation. However, these guidelines extend the scope of the assessment beyond those minimum requirements to allow competent authorities to form a comprehensive view on risks to capital.\n\n162. When evaluating risks to capital, competent authorities should also consider the potential impact of funding cost risk following the methodology included in Title 8 and may decide on the necessity of measures to mitigate this risk.\n\n163. In their implementation of the methodologies specified in this title, competent authorities should identify relevant quantitative indicators and other metrics, which could also be used to monitor key indicators, as specified in Title 3.\n\n164.

While the assessment is intended to be institution-specific, comparison with peers should be considered to identify potential exposure to risks to capital. For such purposes, peers should be defined on a risk-by-risk basis and might differ from those identified for BMA or other analyses.\n\n167. . In the assessment of risks to capital, competent authorities should also evaluate the accuracy and prudency of the calculation of minimum own fund requirements to identify situations where minimum own funds calculations may underestimate the actual level of risk. This assessment would inform the determination of additional own funds requirements as provided in Section 7.2.3.\n\n168. The outcome of the assessment of each material risk should be reflected in a summary of findings that provides an explanation of the main risk drivers, and a risk score, as specified in the following sections.",

Internal governance includes all standards and principles concerned with setting an institution's objectives, strategies and risk management framework; how its business is organised; how responsibilities and authority are defined and clearly allocated; how reporting lines are set up and what information they convey; and how the internal control framework is organised and implemented, including accounting procedures and remuneration policies. Internal governance also encompasses sound information technology systems, outsourcing arrangements and business continuity management.\n\n19. Combating money laundering and terrorist financing is essential for maintaining stability and integrity in the financial system. Uncovering involvement of an institution in money laundering and terrorist financing might have an impact on its viability and the trust in the financial system. Together with the authorities and bodies (e.g. AML supervisors and financial intelligence units) responsible for ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering rules under Directive (EU) 2015/849, competent authorities have an important role to play in identifying and tackling weaknesses. In this context, the guidelines clarify in line with Directive 2013/36/EU that identifying, managing and mitigating money laundering and financing of terrorism risk is part of sound internal governance arrangements and credit institutions' risk management framework.\n\n20. In the same way institutions should take into account environmental, social and governance (ESG) risk factors within their risk management framework.\n\n21. Directive 2013/36/EU sets out requirements aimed at remedying weaknesses that were identified during the financial crisis regarding internal governance arrangements and in particular the sound management and oversight of risks. Identified weaknesses included in particular a lack of effective oversight by the managementbody, in particular in its supervisory function, limited accessibility of the supervisory function and shortcomings regarding the authority, stature and resources of the risk management function.\n\n22. In addition, it is also necessary to take into account developments in this area since the publication of the revised EBA guidelines on internal governance in 2017, such as the updated OECD principles of corporate governance4 and the revised corporate governance principles for banks published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)5. The guidelines align the terminology used regarding risk appetite and risk tolerance with the EBA guidelines on common procedures and methodologies for the SREP and also with the revised BCBS principles; they use the term 'risk appetite' to refer to the aggregate level of risk and the types",

In calculations based on both the current and the nominal value, any increased credit loss risk of the secured receivable shall be appropriately accounted for, at least in cases where the receivable shall, pursuant to Article 178 of the EU Capital Requirements Regulation, be considered non-performing. In calculations based on the nominal value, the cover assets in the cover pool and the impact of currency derivatives contracts shall be taken into account when determining the obligations incurred from covered bonds. In calculations based on the present value, the value of derivatives contracts shall be determined on the basis of present value at the time of valuation.

For such purposes, peers should be defined on a risk-by-risk basis and might differ from those identified for BMA or other analyses.\n\n167. . In the assessment of risks to capital, competent authorities should also evaluate the accuracy and prudency of the calculation of minimum own fund requirements to identify situations where minimum own funds calculations may underestimate the actual level of risk. This assessment would inform the determination of additional own funds requirements as provided in Section 7.2.3.\n\n168. The outcome of the assessment of each material risk should be reflected in a summary of findings that provides an explanation of the main risk drivers, and a risk score, as specified in the following sections.",

Internal governance includes all standards and principles concerned with setting an institution's objectives, strategies and risk management framework; how its business is organised; how responsibilities and authority are defined and clearly allocated; how reporting lines are set up and what information they convey; and how the internal control framework is organised and implemented, including accounting procedures and remuneration policies. Internal governance also encompasses sound information technology systems, outsourcing arrangements and business continuity management.\n\n19. Combating money laundering and terrorist financing is essential for maintaining stability and integrity in the financial system. Uncovering involvement of an institution in money laundering and terrorist financing might have an impact on its viability and the trust in the financial system. Together with the authorities and bodies (e.g. AML supervisors and financial intelligence units) responsible for ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering rules under Directive (EU) 2015/849, competent authorities have an important role to play in identifying and tackling weaknesses. In this context, the guidelines clarify in line with Directive 2013/36/EU that identifying, managing and mitigating money laundering and financing of terrorism risk is part of sound internal governance arrangements and credit institutions' risk management framework.\n\n20. In the same way institutions should take into account environmental, social and governance (ESG) risk factors within their risk management framework.\n\n21. Directive 2013/36/EU sets out requirements aimed at remedying weaknesses that were identified during the financial crisis regarding internal governance arrangements and in particular the sound management and oversight of risks. Identified weaknesses included in particular a lack of effective oversight by the managementbody, in particular in its supervisory function, limited accessibility of the supervisory function and shortcomings regarding the authority, stature and resources of the risk management function.\n\n22. In addition, it is also necessary to take into account developments in this area since the publication of the revised EBA guidelines on internal governance in 2017, such as the updated OECD principles of corporate governance4 and the revised corporate governance principles for banks published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)5. The guidelines align the terminology used regarding risk appetite and risk tolerance with the EBA guidelines on common procedures and methodologies for the SREP and also with the revised BCBS principles; they use the term 'risk appetite' to refer to the aggregate level of risk and the types",

This separation of duties approach should encompass not only client relationship activities (e.g. negotiation of forbearance solutions with clients) but also the decision-making process. In this context, credit institutions should consider implementing dedicated decision- making bodies related to NPE workout (e.g. an NPE committee).\n\n64. Where overlaps with the decision-making bodies, managers or experts involved in the loan origination process are unavoidable, the institutional framework and internal controls should ensure that any potential conflicts of interest are sufficiently mitigated.\n\n65.Credit institutions should have arrangements in place to ensure that regular feedback between loan origination units and NPE WUs is established.\n\n66. When designing an appropriate NPE WU structure, credit institutions should take into account the specificities of their main NPE portfolios, including the type of exposure (retail, SME, corporate) and the type of collateral.\n\n67.Credit institutions should consider designing automated processes for NPE WUs for homogeneous retail NPE portfolios. For corporate NPE portfolios, where relevant, and depending on the sectoral concentration of the NPEs, credit institutions should consider a relationship management approach with sectoral specialisation of NPE WU staff. For sole traders and micro-enterprises, a combination of automated elements and a relationship management approach should be considered.\n\n68.Smaller and less complex credit institutions (e.g. those that are classified in SREP Category 3 or 4) may have in place dedicated workout functions proportionate to their size, nature, complexity and risk profile.

    "paragraph_b_text": "18. Internal governance includes all standards and principles concerned with setting an institution's objectives, strategies and risk management framework; how its business is organised; how responsibilities and authority are defined and clearly allocated; how reporting lines are set up and what information they convey; and how the internal control framework is organised and implemented, including accounting procedures and remuneration policies. Internal governance also encompasses sound information technology systems, outsourcing arrangements and business continuity management.\n\n19. Combating money laundering and terrorist financing is essential for maintaining stability and integrity in the financial system. Uncovering involvement of an institution in money laundering and terrorist financing might have an impact on its viability and the trust in the financial system. Together with the authorities and bodies (e.g. AML supervisors and financial intelligence units) responsible for ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering rules under Directive (EU) 2015/849, competent authorities have an important role to play in identifying and tackling weaknesses. In this context, the guidelines clarify in line with Directive 2013/36/EU that identifying, managing and mitigating money laundering and financing of terrorism risk is part of sound internal governance arrangements and credit institutions' risk management framework.\n\n20. In the same way institutions should take into account environmental, social and governance (ESG) risk factors within their risk management framework.\n\n21. Directive 2013/36/EU sets out requirements aimed at remedying weaknesses that were identified during the financial crisis regarding internal governance arrangements and in particular the sound management and oversight of risks. Identified weaknesses included in particular a lack of effective oversight by the managementbody, in particular in its supervisory function, limited accessibility of the supervisory function and shortcomings regarding the authority, stature and resources of the risk management function.\n\n22. In addition, it is also necessary to take into account developments in this area since the publication of the revised EBA guidelines on internal governance in 2017, such as the updated OECD principles of corporate governance4 and the revised corporate governance principles for banks published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)5. The guidelines align the terminology used regarding risk appetite and risk tolerance with the EBA guidelines on common procedures and methodologies for the SREP and also with the revised BCBS principles; they use the term 'risk appetite' to refer to the aggregate level of risk and the types",

Internal governance includes all standards and principles concerned with setting an institution's objectives, strategies and risk management framework; how its business is organised; how responsibilities and authority are defined and clearly allocated; how reporting lines are set up and what information they convey; and how the internal control framework is organised and implemented, including accounting procedures and remuneration policies. Internal governance also encompasses sound information technology systems, outsourcing arrangements and business continuity management.\n\n19. Combating money laundering and terrorist financing is essential for maintaining stability and integrity in the financial system. Uncovering involvement of an institution in money laundering and terrorist financing might have an impact on its viability and the trust in the financial system. Together with the authorities and bodies (e.g. AML supervisors and financial intelligence units) responsible for ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering rules under Directive (EU) 2015/849, competent authorities have an important role to play in identifying and tackling weaknesses. In this context, the guidelines clarify in line with Directive 2013/36/EU that identifying, managing and mitigating money laundering and financing of terrorism risk is part of sound internal governance arrangements and credit institutions' risk management framework.\n\n20. In the same way institutions should take into account environmental, social and governance (ESG) risk factors within their risk management framework.\n\n21. Directive 2013/36/EU sets out requirements aimed at remedying weaknesses that were identified during the financial crisis regarding internal governance arrangements and in particular the sound management and oversight of risks. Identified weaknesses included in particular a lack of effective oversight by the managementbody, in particular in its supervisory function, limited accessibility of the supervisory function and shortcomings regarding the authority, stature and resources of the risk management function.\n\n22. In addition, it is also necessary to take into account developments in this area since the publication of the revised EBA guidelines on internal governance in 2017, such as the updated OECD principles of corporate governance4 and the revised corporate governance principles for banks published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)5. The guidelines align the terminology used regarding risk appetite and risk tolerance with the EBA guidelines on common procedures and methodologies for the SREP and also with the revised BCBS principles; they use the term 'risk appetite' to refer to the aggregate level of risk and the types",

Together with the authorities and bodies (e.g. AML supervisors and financial intelligence units) responsible for ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering rules under Directive (EU) 2015/849, competent authorities have an important role to play in identifying and tackling weaknesses. In this context, the guidelines clarify in line with Directive 2013/36/EU that identifying, managing and mitigating money laundering and financing of terrorism risk is part of sound internal governance arrangements and credit institutions' risk management framework.\n\n20. In the same way institutions should take into account environmental, social and governance (ESG) risk factors within their risk management framework.\n\n21. Directive 2013/36/EU sets out requirements aimed at remedying weaknesses that were identified during the financial crisis regarding internal governance arrangements and in particular the sound management and oversight of risks. Identified weaknesses included in particular a lack of effective oversight by the managementbody, in particular in its supervisory function, limited accessibility of the supervisory function and shortcomings regarding the authority, stature and resources of the risk management function.\n\n22. In addition, it is also necessary to take into account developments in this area since the publication of the revised EBA guidelines on internal governance in 2017, such as the updated OECD principles of corporate governance4 and the revised corporate governance principles for banks published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)5. The guidelines align the terminology used regarding risk appetite and risk tolerance with the EBA guidelines on common procedures and methodologies for the SREP and also with the revised BCBS principles; they use the term 'risk appetite' to refer to the aggregate level of risk and the types",

The above elements should also be taken into account by competent authorities when they are planning the intensity of their supervisory activity in relation to the assessment of a specific risk.\n\n161. For credit, market and operational risk, competent authorities should verify the institution's compliance with the minimum requirements specified in the relevant EU and national implementing legislation. However, these guidelines extend the scope of the assessment beyond those minimum requirements to allow competent authorities to form a comprehensive view on risks to capital.\n\n162. When evaluating risks to capital, competent authorities should also consider the potential impact of funding cost risk following the methodology included in Title 8 and may decide on the necessity of measures to mitigate this risk.\n\n163. In their implementation of the methodologies specified in this title, competent authorities should identify relevant quantitative indicators and other metrics, which could also be used to monitor key indicators, as specified in Title 3.\n\n164.

Assessment workflow for risks to capital Assessment of inherent individual risks Assessment of individual risks and controls Inherent risk assessment Risk score Assessment of risks management and controls Risk management and controls assessment\n\n166.

In the assessment of risks to capital, competent authorities should also evaluate the accuracy and prudency of the calculation of minimum own fund requirements to identify situations where minimum own funds calculations may underestimate the actual level of risk. This assessment would inform the determination of additional own funds requirements as provided in Section 7.2.3.\n\n168.

Internal governance includes all standards and principles concerned with setting an institution's objectives, strategies and risk management framework; how its business is organised; how responsibilities and authority are defined and clearly allocated; how reporting lines are set up and what information they convey; and how the internal control framework is organised and implemented, including accounting procedures and remuneration policies.

Combating money laundering and terrorist financing is essential for maintaining stability and integrity in the financial system. Uncovering involvement of an institution in money laundering and terrorist financing might have an impact on its viability and the trust in the financial system. Together with the authorities and bodies (e.g. AML supervisors and financial intelligence units) responsible for ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering rules under Directive (EU) 2015/849, competent authorities have an important role to play in identifying and tackling weaknesses. In this context, the guidelines clarify in line with Directive 2013/36/EU that identifying, managing and mitigating money laundering and financing of terrorism risk is part of sound internal governance arrangements and credit institutions' risk management framework.\n\n20. In the same way institutions should take into account environmental, social and governance (ESG) risk factors within their risk management framework.\n\n21. Directive 2013/36/EU sets out requirements aimed at remedying weaknesses that were identified during the financial crisis regarding internal governance arrangements and in particular the sound management and oversight of risks. Identified weaknesses included in particular a lack of effective oversight by the managementbody, in particular in its supervisory function, limited accessibility of the supervisory function and shortcomings regarding the authority, stature and resources of the risk management function.\n\n22. In addition, it is also necessary to take into account developments in this area since the publication of the revised EBA guidelines on internal governance in 2017, such as the updated OECD principles of corporate governance4 and the revised corporate governance principles for banks published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)5. The guidelines align the terminology used regarding risk appetite and risk tolerance with the EBA guidelines on common procedures and methodologies for the SREP and also with the revised BCBS principles; they use the term 'risk appetite' to refer to the aggregate level of risk and the types",

However, these guidelines extend the scope of the assessment beyond those minimum requirements to allow competent authorities to form a comprehensive view on risks to capital.\n\n162. When evaluating risks to capital, competent authorities should also consider the potential impact of funding cost risk following the methodology included in Title 8 and may decide on the necessity of measures to mitigate this risk.\n\n163. In their implementation of the methodologies specified in this title, competent authorities should identify relevant quantitative indicators and other metrics, which could also be used to monitor key indicators, as specified in Title 3.\n\n164.

In the assessment of risks to capital, competent authorities should also evaluate the accuracy and prudency of the calculation of minimum own fund requirements to identify situations where minimum own funds calculations may underestimate the actual level of risk. This assessment would inform the determination of additional own funds requirements as provided in Section 7.2.3.\n\n168.

Combating money laundering and terrorist financing is essential for maintaining stability and integrity in the financial system. Uncovering involvement of an institution in money laundering and terrorist financing might have an impact on its viability and the trust in the financial system. Together with the authorities and bodies (e.g. AML supervisors and financial intelligence units) responsible for ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering rules under Directive (EU) 2015/849, competent authorities have an important role to play in identifying and tackling weaknesses. In this context, the guidelines clarify in line with Directive 2013/36/EU that identifying, managing and mitigating money laundering and financing of terrorism risk is part of sound internal governance arrangements and credit institutions' risk management framework.\n\n20. In the same way institutions should take into account environmental, social and governance (ESG) risk factors within their risk management framework.\n\n21.

In addition, it is also necessary to take into account developments in this area since the publication of the revised EBA guidelines on internal governance in 2017, such as the updated OECD principles of corporate governance4 and the revised corporate governance principles for banks published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)5. The guidelines align the terminology used regarding risk appetite and risk tolerance with the EBA guidelines on common procedures and methodologies for the SREP and also with the revised BCBS principles; they use the term 'risk appetite' to refer to the aggregate level of risk and the types",

For credit, market and operational risk, competent authorities should verify the institution's compliance with the minimum requirements specified in the relevant EU and national implementing legislation. However, these guidelines extend the scope of the assessment beyond those minimum requirements to allow competent authorities to form a comprehensive view on risks to capital.\n\n162. When evaluating risks to capital, competent authorities should also consider the potential impact of funding cost risk following the methodology included in Title 8 and may decide on the necessity of measures to mitigate this risk.\n\n163. In their implementation of the methodologies specified in this title, competent authorities should identify relevant quantitative indicators and other metrics, which could also be used to monitor key indicators, as specified in Title 3.\n\n164. For each material risk, competent authorities should assess and reflect in the risk score: a. inherent risk (risk exposures); and b. the quality and effectiveness of risk management and controls.\n\n165.

While the assessment is intended to be institution-specific, comparison with peers should be considered to identify potential exposure to risks to capital. For such purposes, peers should be defined on a risk-by-risk basis and might differ from those identified for BMA or other analyses.\n\n167. . In the assessment of risks to capital, competent authorities should also evaluate the accuracy and prudency of the calculation of minimum own fund requirements to identify situations where minimum own funds calculations may underestimate the actual level of risk. This assessment would inform the determination of additional own funds requirements as provided in Section 7.2.3.\n\n168. The outcome of the assessment of each material risk should be reflected in a summary of findings that provides an explanation of the main risk drivers, and a risk score, as specified in the following sections.",

Combating money laundering and terrorist financing is essential for maintaining stability and integrity in the financial system. Uncovering involvement of an institution in money laundering and terrorist financing might have an impact on its viability and the trust in the financial system. Together with the authorities and bodies (e.g. AML supervisors and financial intelligence units) responsible for ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering rules under Directive (EU) 2015/849, competent authorities have an important role to play in identifying and tackling weaknesses. In this context, the guidelines clarify in line with Directive 2013/36/EU that identifying, managing and mitigating money laundering and financing of terrorism risk is part of sound internal governance arrangements and credit institutions' risk management framework.\n\n20.

However, these guidelines extend the scope of the assessment beyond those minimum requirements to allow competent authorities to form a comprehensive view on risks to capital.\n\n162. When evaluating risks to capital, competent authorities should also consider the potential impact of funding cost risk following the methodology included in Title 8 and may decide on the necessity of measures to mitigate this risk.\n\n163. In their implementation of the methodologies specified in this title, competent authorities should identify relevant quantitative indicators and other metrics, which could also be used to monitor key indicators, as specified in Title 3.\n\n164.

While the assessment is intended to be institution-specific, comparison with peers should be considered to identify potential exposure to risks to capital. For such purposes, peers should be defined on a risk-by-risk basis and might differ from those identified for BMA or other analyses.\n\n167. . In the assessment of risks to capital, competent authorities should also evaluate the accuracy and prudency of the calculation of minimum own fund requirements to identify situations where minimum own funds calculations may underestimate the actual level of risk. This assessment would inform the determination of additional own funds requirements as provided in Section 7.2.3.\n\n168. The outcome of the assessment of each material risk should be reflected in a summary of findings that provides an explanation of the main risk drivers, and a risk score, as specified in the following sections.",

Combating money laundering and terrorist financing is essential for maintaining stability and integrity in the financial system. Uncovering involvement of an institution in money laundering and terrorist financing might have an impact on its viability and the trust in the financial system. Together with the authorities and bodies (e.g. AML supervisors and financial intelligence units) responsible for ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering rules under Directive (EU) 2015/849, competent authorities have an important role to play in identifying and tackling weaknesses. In this context, the guidelines clarify in line with Directive 2013/36/EU that identifying, managing and mitigating money laundering and financing of terrorism risk is part of sound internal governance arrangements and credit institutions' risk management framework.\n\n20. In the same way institutions should take into account environmental, social and governance (ESG) risk factors within their risk management framework.\n\n21.

Identified weaknesses included in particular a lack of effective oversight by the managementbody, in particular in its supervisory function, limited accessibility of the supervisory function and shortcomings regarding the authority, stature and resources of the risk management function.\n\n22. In addition, it is also necessary to take into account developments in this area since the publication of the revised EBA guidelines on internal governance in 2017, such as the updated OECD principles of corporate governance4 and the revised corporate governance principles for banks published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)5. The guidelines align the terminology used regarding risk appetite and risk tolerance with the EBA guidelines on common procedures and methodologies for the SREP and also with the revised BCBS principles; they use the term 'risk appetite' to refer to the aggregate level of risk and the types",

Internal governance includes all standards and principles concerned with setting an institution's objectives, strategies and risk management framework; how its business is organised; how responsibilities and authority are defined and clearly allocated; how reporting lines are set up and what information they convey; and how the internal control framework is organised and implemented, including accounting procedures and remuneration policies. Internal governance also encompasses sound information technology systems, outsourcing arrangements and business continuity management.\n\n19. Combating money laundering and terrorist financing is essential for maintaining stability and integrity in the financial system. Uncovering involvement of an institution in money laundering and terrorist financing might have an impact on its viability and the trust in the financial system. Together with the authorities and bodies (e.g. AML supervisors and financial intelligence units) responsible for ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering rules under Directive (EU) 2015/849, competent authorities have an important role to play in identifying and tackling weaknesses. In this context, the guidelines clarify in line with Directive 2013/36/EU that identifying, managing and mitigating money laundering and financing of terrorism risk is part of sound internal governance arrangements and credit institutions' risk management framework.\n\n20. In the same way institutions should take into account environmental, social and governance (ESG) risk factors within their risk management framework.\n\n21. Directive 2013/36/EU sets out requirements aimed at remedying weaknesses that were identified during the financial crisis regarding internal governance arrangements and in particular the sound management and oversight of risks. Identified weaknesses included in particular a lack of effective oversight by the managementbody, in particular in its supervisory function, limited accessibility of the supervisory function and shortcomings regarding the authority, stature and resources of the risk management function.\n\n22. In addition, it is also necessary to take into account developments in this area since the publication of the revised EBA guidelines on internal governance in 2017, such as the updated OECD principles of corporate governance4 and the revised corporate governance principles for banks published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)5. The guidelines align the terminology used regarding risk appetite and risk tolerance with the EBA guidelines on common procedures and methodologies for the SREP and also with the revised BCBS principles; they use the term 'risk appetite' to refer to the aggregate level of risk and the types",

For the purposes of justifying situations where the specific credit risk adjustments exceed the ELBE estimates in accordance with Article 54(2)(f) of the RTS on IRB assessment methodology, institutions should ensure consistency of the ELBE estimates with the economic loss components described in section 6.3.1 as well as with the definition of default set out in Article 178 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and analyse any differences in that regard from the definitions and methods used for the purpose of determining specific credit risk adjustments. In particular, institutions should take into account, the possible differences in the discounting rate, the presence of collateral that is not eligible under Article 181(1)(f) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, different treatments of costs and the application of different definitions of default.",

The value of the overcollateralisation shall constantly be at least two per cent. If the requirements laid down in Article 129(3)(a)(3) of the EU Capital Requirements Regulation are not met, the overcollateralisation value shall be at minimum five per cent. In addition to the part laid down in this subsection, the overcollateralisation shall also cover the estimated winding-down costs related to covered bonds. The overcollateralisation amount shall be determined by a calculation method based on present value. When calculating the present value, payments of loan receivables included in the cover pool shall be taken into account in the proportion in which these loan receivables are included in the calculation of the cover pool total value as referred to in section 23 above. If the calculation method based on present value produces a higher cover pool total value than the method based on the nominal value of obligations incurred from the covered bonds, the overcollateralisation shall be determined on the basis of the nominal value. In calculations based on both the current and the nominal value, any increased credit loss risk of the secured receivable shall be appropriately accounted for, at least in cases where the receivable shall, pursuant to Article 178 of the EU Capital Requirements Regulation, be considered non-performing. In calculations based on the nominal value, the cover assets in the cover pool and the impact of currency derivatives contracts shall be taken into account when determining the obligations incurred from covered bonds. In calculations based on the present value, the value of derivatives contracts shall be determined on the basis of present value at the time of valuation. The same method shall be used to determine both the total value of the cover pool and the obligations incurred from the covered bonds. The Financial Supervisory Authority may issue further regulations on the valuation of derivatives and taking total cash flows into account when calculating cover pool total value. The Financial Supervisory Authority may also issue further regulations on the methods used to calculate and value overcollateralisation. REGULATION (paragraphs 2-3)\n\n(2) In both nominal and present value-based calculation, the same method based on the fair value or book value, where lower than the fair value, shall be applied to the substitution assets referred to in section 18 of the MCBCBA and assets used to cover the liquidity buffer requirement under section 31 of the MCBCBA, which is applied to the determination of the liquidity buffer requirement under section 31 of the MCBCBA.\n\n(3) In the valuation of short-term exposures or short-term deposits referred to in section 18, subsection 1, paragraph 2 of the MCBCBA, the book value of the exposure or deposit shall be applied.

If the requirements laid down in Article 129(3)(a)(3) of the EU Capital Requirements Regulation are not met, the overcollateralisation value shall be at minimum five per cent. In addition to the part laid down in this subsection, the overcollateralisation shall also cover the estimated winding-down costs related to covered bonds.

When calculating the present value, payments of loan receivables included in the cover pool shall be taken into account in the proportion in which these loan receivables are included in the calculation of the cover pool total value as referred to in section 23 above. If the calculation method based on present value produces a higher cover pool total value than the method based on the nominal value of obligations incurred from the covered bonds, the overcollateralisation shall be determined on the basis of the nominal value. In calculations based on both the current and the nominal value, any increased credit loss risk of the secured receivable shall be appropriately accounted for, at least in cases where the receivable shall, pursuant to Article 178 of the EU Capital Requirements Regulation, be considered non-performing.

IFRS 9, paragraph 5.5.4, states that 'the objective of the impairment requirements is to recognise lifetime expected credit losses for all financial instruments for which there have been significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition - whether assessed on an 38 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT INSTITUTIONS' CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND ACCOUNTING FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY individual or collective basis - considering all reasonable and supportable information, including that which is forward-looking.'\n\n97. The rationale for this approach is that the creditworthiness of the counterparty, and thus the ECL anticipated upon initial recognition, is taken into account in the pricing of credit at that time. It follows, then, that a post-origination increase in credit risk may not be fully compensated by the interest rate charged, and, as a consequence, credit institutions should carefully consider whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk30. If so, the lending exposure should be subject to lifetime ECL measurement.\n\n98. In order to consider whether an exposure has suffered a significant increase in credit risk and the measurement of required 12-month ECL and lifetime ECL, credit institutions should have in place sound governance, systems and controls, in accordance with the principles specified in these guidelines. Unless already established, credit institutions should implement systems that are capable of handling and systematically assessing the large amounts of information that will be required to judge whether or not particular lending exposures or groups of lending exposures exhibit a significant increase in credit risk, and to measure lifetime ECL where that is the case. Parent undertakings and subsidiaries subject to Directive 2013/36/EU should ensure that the approach is consistent across the group. This should include, in particular, putting in place processes to ensure that forecasts of economic conditions in different jurisdictions and economic sectors are reviewed and approved by a credit institution's senior management, and that the process, controls and economic assumptions around developing forecasts and linking these to expectations of credit loss are consistent across the group. The need for consistency should not be interpreted as a requirement that the practice be identical across a group. On the contrary, within a consistent framework there may be differences across jurisdictions and products, depending for instance on the availability of data. These differences should be well documented and justified.\n\n99. Credit institutions' processes in place should enable them to determine on a timely and holistic basis whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk subsequent to the initial recognition of a lending exposure so that an individual exposure, or a group of exposures with similar credit risk characteristics, is transferred to lifetime ECL measurement as soon as credit risk has increased significantly, in accordance with the IFRS 9 impairment accounting requirements.\n\n100. As noted in paragraph B5.5.17 of IFRS 9 on assessing significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition, the range of information that will need to be considered in making this determination is wide. In broad terms, it will include information on macroeconomic conditions, and the economic sector and geographical region relevant to a particular borrower or a group of borrowers with shared credit risk characteristics, in addition to borrower-specific strategic, operational and other characteristics.

Resolution may involve initiating legal procedures, foreclosing assets, debt to asset/equity swap, disposal of credit facilities by sale, transferal to an asset management company or securitisation.

Liquidation activities should be monitored by the credit institution to help inform strategies and policies. Credit institutions should monitor disposals and monitor realised sales/transfer prices against net carrying amounts.\n\n118. Credit institutions should monitor the volumes and recovery rates of legal and foreclosure cases.

The data regarding the recovery rates from foreclosures should be monitored on an ongoing basis and feed into potential amendments to credit institutions' strategies for handling their debt recovery/legal portfolios.\n\n121. Credit institutions should also monitor the average duration of legal procedures recently completed and the average amounts recovered (including related recovery costs) from these completed procedures.\n\n122. Credit institutions should carefully monitor cases where the debt is swapped with an asset or equity of the borrower, at least by using volume indicators by type of assets, and ensure compliance with any limits set by the relevant national regulations on holdings. The use of this approach as a forbearance measure should be backed by a proper business plan and limited to assets in relation to which the institution has sufficient expertise and the market realistically allows the determined value to be extracted from the asset in the short to medium term.

In order to do so, the assessment of the financial situation of the borrower should not be limited to exposures with apparent signs of financial difficulties. An assessment of financial difficulties should also be conducted for exposures with regard to which the borrower does not have apparent financial difficulties but in relation to which market conditions have changed significantly in a way that could impact the borrower's ability to repay (e.g. bullet loans the repayment of which will depend on the sale of immovable property or foreign currency loans).\n\n151. The assessment of any financial difficulties on the part of a borrower should be based on the situation of the borrower only, disregarding collateral or any guarantees provided by third parties. When assessing the financial difficulties of the borrower, credit institutions, in accordance with Annex V to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014, should consider at least the following rebuttable circumstances: a) borrower/facility more than 30 days past due during the three months prior to its modification or refinancing; b) increase in probability of default (PD) of credit institution's internal rating class during the three months prior to its modification or refinancing; c) presence on a watch list during the three months prior to its modification or refinancing.\n\n152.

In line with Annex V to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014, when a borrower is in financial difficulties, a change in conditions in line with what other borrowers with a similar risk profile could get from the credit institution should qualify as a concession, including when borrowers are included in public forbearance schemes that are offered by credit institutions.\n\n154.

Generally, these exposures tend to be of a significant size relative to the portfolio and so represent a source of credit concentration, of long maturity, which makes it difficult to make reliable projections of profitability.\n\n200. In assessing the specialised lending exposures, where they are considered material,, competent authorities should consider: a. the profitability of the projects and the conservativeness of the assumptions underlying the business plans (including the credit risk of the main customers); b. the impact of changes in regulation, especially for subsidised sectors, on future cash flows; c. the impact of changing market demand, where relevant, and the existence of a market for the potential future sale of the object financed; d. the existence of a syndicate or of other lenders sharing the credit risk; and e. any form of guarantee pledged by the sponsors.

Such an assessment should particularly focus, where relevant, on participation risk in strategic holdings (both insurance and non-insurance). Real-estate risk\n\n202. Competent authorities should assess the risk of decline in the value of the institution's real estate investments and ensure that this risk is appropriately captured by the institution's risk framework. Such an assessment should also focus, where relevant, on the value of financial instruments linked to real estate assets (e.g. real estate investment trusts, REITs). Model risk for regulatory approved models\n\n203. In cases where institutions are using regulatory approved internal models for the purpose of calculating own funds requirements for credit risk, competent authorities should monitor whether the institution continues to fulfil the minimum requirements and ensure that related own funds requirements are not underestimated. The assessment of model risk may be based on the insights gained in other supervisory actions, including those carried out in accordance with Article 101 of Directive 2013/36/EU. 84 Assessment of the portfolio credit quality\n\n204. In assessing inherent credit risk, competent authorities should consider the quality of the credit portfolio, by carrying out an analysis to distinguish between performing, non-performing and forborne exposure categories, taking into account requirements of the EBA Guidelines on management of non-performing and forborne exposures33.\n\n205. Competent authorities should assess the overall credit quality at portfolio level and the different quality grades within each of the above categories to determine the institution's overall credit risk. As part of this assessment competent authorities should analyse default and migration risk by exposure classes, taking into account trends in the credit quality over time, and they should consider whether the actual credit quality is consistent with the stated risk appetite, and establish reasons for any deviations.\n\n206. When assessing portfolio credit quality, competent authorities should pay particular attention to the adequacy of the classification of credit exposures and assess the impact of potential misclassification, with the subsequent delay in the provisioning and recognition of losses by the institution. In conducting this assessment, competent authorities may use peer analysis and benchmark portfolios, where available. Competent authorities may also use sampling of loans when assessing portfolio credit quality. Performing exposures\n\n207. In evaluating the credit quality of performing exposures, competent authorities should consider the change in the portfolio in terms of composition, size and creditworthiness, its profitability and the risk of future deterioration, by analysing the following elements, where available: a. borrowers' credit grade distribution (e.g. by internal and/or external ratings or other information suitable for measuring creditworthiness, such as leverage ratio, ratio of revenues devoted to the payment of instalments, etc.); b. growth rates by types of borrowers, sectors and products and consistency with credit risk strategies; c. sensitivity of borrowers' credit grades, or more generally of borrowers' repayment capacities, to the economic cycle; d. historical migration rates across credit grades, delinquency and default rates for different time horizons; and e. profitability (e.g. credit spread vs. credit losses).",

Competent authorities should also assess the materiality of the residual risk (see Article 80 of Directive 2013/36/EU) and in particular: a. the adequacy and enforceability of collateral agreements and of guarantees; b. the timing and the ability to realise collateral and execute guarantees under the national legal framework; c. the liquidity and volatility in asset values for collateral; d. the recoverable value of collateral under any credit enforcement actions (e.g. foreclosure procedures); and e. where relevant, the guarantors' creditworthiness following the requirements of the EBA Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring.\n\n215. Competent authorities should also assess the concentration of guarantors and collateral, as well as the correlation with borrowers' creditworthiness (i.e. wrong-way risk) and the potential impact in terms of the effectiveness of protection. 87 Assessment of the level of loan loss provisions and credit valuation adjustments\n\n216. Competent authorities should assess whether the level of loan loss provisions and credit valuation adjustments are appropriate for the quality of the exposures and, where relevant, for the level of collateral. Competent authorities should assess: a. whether the level of loan loss provisions is consistent with the level of risk in different portfolios, over time and compared with the institution's relevant peers; b. whether the credit valuation adjustments to derivatives' market values reflect the creditworthiness of relevant counterparties; c. whether accounting loan loss provisions are in line with applicable accounting principles and are assessed as sufficient to cover expected losses; d. whether non-performing, forborne exposures and foreclosed assets have been subject to sufficient loan loss provisions, taking into account the level of existing collateral and the vintage of such exposures and applicable legal requirements for the minimum loss coverage of non-performing exposures; and e. whether loan loss provisions are consistent with historical losses and relevant macroeconomic developments and reflect any changes to relevant regulations (e.g. foreclosure, repossession, creditor protection, etc.).\n\n217. Where deemed necessary, competent authorities should use on-site inspections or other appropriate supervisory actions to assess whether or not the level of loan loss provisioning and risk coverage is adequate, by assessing a sample of loans, for example.\n\n218. Competent authorities should also take into consideration any findings raised by internal and external auditors, where available. Stress testing\n\n219. When evaluating the inherent credit risk of an institution, competent authorities should take into account the results of stress tests performed by the institution to identify any previously unidentified sources of credit risk, such as those emerging from changes in credit quality, credit concentrations, collateral value and credit exposure during a stressed period.",

The GL provide principles for institutions on how to achieve a sufficient level of legal certainty while avoiding excessive burden and unjustified costs. In particular, the GL specify a minimum list of jurisdictions that should be considered relevant for a given physical collateral other than immovable property, and for which the legal opinion should be provided. In addition, institutions should consider whether for a given collateral there are also other jurisdictions that should be considered relevant.\n\n20. The list of jurisdictions that should be considered relevant includes the jurisdiction where it is most likely that the realisation of the collateral would be carried out, should this be necessary. While in some cases it may not be easy to foresee the place of realisation of collateral, the choice of this most likely jurisdiction could be based on one of the following considerations: · contractual specification of the location to which the obligor is obliged to move the collateral in the event of non-payment; · legal obligation of the obligor to move the collateral to a location specified by the creditor, stemming from international regulations or conventions; · previous experience with regard to realising collateral of the same type; . in cases such as leasing exposures, where the asset is owned by the institution, the most likely choice of the institution. In some cases, it may be difficult to specify just one jurisdiction where the potential realisation of collateral would take place. In such case, where there are two or more jurisdictions where the realisation of collateral is equally likely, institutions should include jurisdictions considered relevant, as specified in paragraph 23(e) of the GL.\n\n21.It should be noted that the GL do not require a separate legal opinion for each relevant jurisdiction. Where possible, institutions may rely on a single legal opinion covering several jurisdictions. This may be possible in particular in those cases where international regulations have been adopted that provide a robust international framework enforcing creditors' rights over their collateral. Such regulations would typically have a form of an international convention that has been adopted or confirmed by a number of jurisdictions. The assessment based on 11 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT RISK MITIGATION EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY international regulations should therefore include a clear identification of whether these regulations cover all jurisdictions relevant for a given collateral and an assessment of whether they ensure legal effectiveness and enforceability of the collateral, as well as the types of collateral that are subject to the regulations.",

In order to do so, the assessment of the financial situation of the borrower should not be limited to exposures with apparent signs of financial difficulties. An assessment of financial difficulties should also be conducted for exposures with regard to which the borrower does not have apparent financial difficulties but in relation to which market conditions have changed significantly in a way that could impact the borrower's ability to repay (e.g. bullet loans the repayment of which will depend on the sale of immovable property or foreign currency loans).\n\n151. The assessment of any financial difficulties on the part of a borrower should be based on the situation of the borrower only, disregarding collateral or any guarantees provided by third parties. When assessing the financial difficulties of the borrower, credit institutions, in accordance with Annex V to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014, should consider at least the following rebuttable circumstances: a) borrower/facility more than 30 days past due during the three months prior to its modification or refinancing; b) increase in probability of default (PD) of credit institution's internal rating class during the three months prior to its modification or refinancing; c) presence on a watch list during the three months prior to its modification or refinancing.\n\n152.

    "paragraph_b_text": "199. Generally, these exposures tend to be of a significant size relative to the portfolio and so represent a source of credit concentration, of long maturity, which makes it difficult to make reliable projections of profitability.\n\n200. In assessing the specialised lending exposures, where they are considered material,, competent authorities should consider: a. the profitability of the projects and the conservativeness of the assumptions underlying the business plans (including the credit risk of the main customers); b. the impact of changes in regulation, especially for subsidised sectors, on future cash flows; c. the impact of changing market demand, where relevant, and the existence of a market for the potential future sale of the object financed; d. the existence of a syndicate or of other lenders sharing the credit risk; and e. any form of guarantee pledged by the sponsors. Equity risk in the banking book\n\n201. Competent authorities should assess the risk of decline in the value of the institution's equity investments and ensure that this risk is appropriately captured by the institution's risk framework. Such an assessment should particularly focus, where relevant, on participation risk in strategic holdings (both insurance and non-insurance). Real-estate risk\n\n202. Competent authorities should assess the risk of decline in the value of the institution's real estate investments and ensure that this risk is appropriately captured by the institution's risk framework. Such an assessment should also focus, where relevant, on the value of financial instruments linked to real estate assets (e.g. real estate investment trusts, REITs). Model risk for regulatory approved models\n\n203. In cases where institutions are using regulatory approved internal models for the purpose of calculating own funds requirements for credit risk, competent authorities should monitor whether the institution continues to fulfil the minimum requirements and ensure that related own funds requirements are not underestimated. The assessment of model risk may be based on the insights gained in other supervisory actions, including those carried out in accordance with Article 101 of Directive 2013/36/EU. 84 Assessment of the portfolio credit quality\n\n204. In assessing inherent credit risk, competent authorities should consider the quality of the credit portfolio, by carrying out an analysis to distinguish between performing, non-performing and forborne exposure categories, taking into account requirements of the EBA Guidelines on management of non-performing and forborne exposures33.\n\n205. Competent authorities should assess the overall credit quality at portfolio level and the different quality grades within each of the above categories to determine the institution's overall credit risk. As part of this assessment competent authorities should analyse default and migration risk by exposure classes, taking into account trends in the credit quality over time, and they should consider whether the actual credit quality is consistent with the stated risk appetite, and establish reasons for any deviations.\n\n206. When assessing portfolio credit quality, competent authorities should pay particular attention to the adequacy of the classification of credit exposures and assess the impact of potential misclassification, with the subsequent delay in the provisioning and recognition of losses by the institution. In conducting this assessment, competent authorities may use peer analysis and benchmark portfolios, where available. Competent authorities may also use sampling of loans when assessing portfolio credit quality. Performing exposures\n\n207. In evaluating the credit quality of performing exposures, competent authorities should consider the change in the portfolio in terms of composition, size and creditworthiness, its profitability and the risk of future deterioration, by analysing the following elements, where available: a. borrowers' credit grade distribution (e.g. by internal and/or external ratings or other information suitable for measuring creditworthiness, such as leverage ratio, ratio of revenues devoted to the payment of instalments, etc.); b. growth rates by types of borrowers, sectors and products and consistency with credit risk strategies; c. sensitivity of borrowers' credit grades, or more generally of borrowers' repayment capacities, to the economic cycle; d. historical migration rates across credit grades, delinquency and default rates for different time horizons; and e. profitability (e.g. credit spread vs. credit losses).",

In performing these analyses, competent authorities should consider both the number of obligors and the relevant amounts/volumes and take into account the level of portfolio concentration. Forborne exposures\n\n209. Competent authorities should assess the extent of forborne exposures, and the potential losses that may stem from them. As a minimum, this should include: a. the forbearance rates per portfolio and changes over time, also compared to peers; b. the forbearance rates for different types of forbearance measures, including time horizons of the measures; c. the level and quality of collateralisation of forborne exposures; and d. the migration rates of forborne exposures to performing and non-performing exposures, also compared with peers. Non-performing exposures\n\n210. Competent authorities should assess the materiality of non-performing exposures, including per portfolio and the potential losses that may stem from them. As a minimum, this should include: a. the non-performing rates and coverage per portfolio, sector, geography and changes over time, also taking into account the changes in the portfolios (e.g. growing portfolios vs expiring portfolios) and strategy with regard to non- performing exposures (e.g. recent sales of non-performing exposures); b. the distribution of the exposures across classes of non-performing exposures (i.e. past-due, doubtful, etc.); c. the types and values of collateral, where relevant; d. the migration rates from non-performing classes to performing, forborne exposures, and across non-performing classes; e. foreclosed assets and changes over time; f. historical recovery rates by portfolio, sector, geography or type of collateral and the duration of the recovery process; and g. the time since exposures were classified as non-performing, analysed by time buckets (vintage). 86\n\n211. In conducting the above analysis, competent authorities should employ peer analysis and use benchmark portfolios (i.e. portfolios of borrowers common to groups of institutions) where appropriate and possible. Assessment of the level and quality of credit risk mitigation\n\n212. To assess the potential impact of credit risk on the institution, competent authorities should also consider the level and quality of guarantees (including credit derivatives) and of available collateral that would mitigate credit losses where credit events occur, including those not accepted as eligible credit risk mitigation techniques for own funds calculations.\n\n213. 3. Specifically, competent authorities should consider: a. the coverage provided by collateral and guarantees by portfolio, borrower type, rating, sector and other relevant aspects; b. collateral values, for performing and non-performing exposures, including to what degree they meet the requirements of the EBA Guidelines on management of non- performing and forborne exposures (for collateral used to secure non-performing exposures) and EBA Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring (for all collateral); c. historical recovery ratios by type and amount of collateral and guarantees; and d. the materiality of the dilution risk (see Article 4 of Regulation (EU) 575/2013) for purchased receivables.\n\n214. Competent authorities should also assess the materiality of the residual risk (see Article 80 of Directive 2013/36/EU) and in particular: a. the adequacy and enforceability of collateral agreements and of guarantees; b. the timing and the ability to realise collateral and execute guarantees under the national legal framework; c. the liquidity and volatility in asset values for collateral; d. the recoverable value of collateral under any credit enforcement actions (e.g. foreclosure procedures); and e. where relevant, the guarantors' creditworthiness following the requirements of the EBA Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring.\n\n215. Competent authorities should also assess the concentration of guarantors and collateral, as well as the correlation with borrowers' creditworthiness (i.e. wrong-way risk) and the potential impact in terms of the effectiveness of protection. 87 Assessment of the level of loan loss provisions and credit valuation adjustments\n\n216. Competent authorities should assess whether the level of loan loss provisions and credit valuation adjustments are appropriate for the quality of the exposures and, where relevant, for the level of collateral. Competent authorities should assess: a. whether the level of loan loss provisions is consistent with the level of risk in different portfolios, over time and compared with the institution's relevant peers; b. whether the credit valuation adjustments to derivatives' market values reflect the creditworthiness of relevant counterparties; c. whether accounting loan loss provisions are in line with applicable accounting principles and are assessed as sufficient to cover expected losses; d. whether non-performing, forborne exposures and foreclosed assets have been subject to sufficient loan loss provisions, taking into account the level of existing collateral and the vintage of such exposures and applicable legal requirements for the minimum loss coverage of non-performing exposures; and e. whether loan loss provisions are consistent with historical losses and relevant macroeconomic developments and reflect any changes to relevant regulations (e.g. foreclosure, repossession, creditor protection, etc.).\n\n217. Where deemed necessary, competent authorities should use on-site inspections or other appropriate supervisory actions to assess whether or not the level of loan loss provisioning and risk coverage is adequate, by assessing a sample of loans, for example.\n\n218. Competent authorities should also take into consideration any findings raised by internal and external auditors, where available. Stress testing\n\n219. When evaluating the inherent credit risk of an institution, competent authorities should take into account the results of stress tests performed by the institution to identify any previously unidentified sources of credit risk, such as those emerging from changes in credit quality, credit concentrations, collateral value and credit exposure during a stressed period.",

    "paragraph_b_text": "19.While it is important to ensure legal certainty of the CRM techniques, especially when they are recognised in the calculation of own funds requirements, the EBA recognises that assessing legal certainty may be challenging, in particular in cases where the collateral has the form of a movable physical asset. The GL provide principles for institutions on how to achieve a sufficient level of legal certainty while avoiding excessive burden and unjustified costs. In particular, the GL specify a minimum list of jurisdictions that should be considered relevant for a given physical collateral other than immovable property, and for which the legal opinion should be provided. In addition, institutions should consider whether for a given collateral there are also other jurisdictions that should be considered relevant.\n\n20. The list of jurisdictions that should be considered relevant includes the jurisdiction where it is most likely that the realisation of the collateral would be carried out, should this be necessary. While in some cases it may not be easy to foresee the place of realisation of collateral, the choice of this most likely jurisdiction could be based on one of the following considerations: · contractual specification of the location to which the obligor is obliged to move the collateral in the event of non-payment; · legal obligation of the obligor to move the collateral to a location specified by the creditor, stemming from international regulations or conventions; · previous experience with regard to realising collateral of the same type; . in cases such as leasing exposures, where the asset is owned by the institution, the most likely choice of the institution. In some cases, it may be difficult to specify just one jurisdiction where the potential realisation of collateral would take place. In such case, where there are two or more jurisdictions where the realisation of collateral is equally likely, institutions should include jurisdictions considered relevant, as specified in paragraph 23(e) of the GL.\n\n21.It should be noted that the GL do not require a separate legal opinion for each relevant jurisdiction. Where possible, institutions may rely on a single legal opinion covering several jurisdictions. This may be possible in particular in those cases where international regulations have been adopted that provide a robust international framework enforcing creditors' rights over their collateral. Such regulations would typically have a form of an international convention that has been adopted or confirmed by a number of jurisdictions. The assessment based on 11 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT RISK MITIGATION EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY international regulations should therefore include a clear identification of whether these regulations cover all jurisdictions relevant for a given collateral and an assessment of whether they ensure legal effectiveness and enforceability of the collateral, as well as the types of collateral that are subject to the regulations.",

In order to do so, the assessment of the financial situation of the borrower should not be limited to exposures with apparent signs of financial difficulties. An assessment of financial difficulties should also be conducted for exposures with regard to which the borrower does not have apparent financial difficulties but in relation to which market conditions have changed significantly in a way that could impact the borrower's ability to repay (e.g. bullet loans the repayment of which will depend on the sale of immovable property or foreign currency loans).\n\n151. The assessment of any financial difficulties on the part of a borrower should be based on the situation of the borrower only, disregarding collateral or any guarantees provided by third parties. When assessing the financial difficulties of the borrower, credit institutions, in accordance with Annex V to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014, should consider at least the following rebuttable circumstances: a) borrower/facility more than 30 days past due during the three months prior to its modification or refinancing; b) increase in probability of default (PD) of credit institution's internal rating class during the three months prior to its modification or refinancing; c) presence on a watch list during the three months prior to its modification or refinancing.\n\n152. Exposures should not be identified as forborne when concessions are made to borrowers who are not in financial difficulties.

Generally, these exposures tend to be of a significant size relative to the portfolio and so represent a source of credit concentration, of long maturity, which makes it difficult to make reliable projections of profitability.\n\n200.

In assessing inherent credit risk, competent authorities should consider the quality of the credit portfolio, by carrying out an analysis to distinguish between performing, non-performing and forborne exposure categories, taking into account requirements of the EBA Guidelines on management of non-performing and forborne exposures33.\n\n205. Competent authorities should assess the overall credit quality at portfolio level and the different quality grades within each of the above categories to determine the institution's overall credit risk. As part of this assessment competent authorities should analyse default and migration risk by exposure classes, taking into account trends in the credit quality over time, and they should consider whether the actual credit quality is consistent with the stated risk appetite, and establish reasons for any deviations.\n\n206. When assessing portfolio credit quality, competent authorities should pay particular attention to the adequacy of the classification of credit exposures and assess the impact of potential misclassification, with the subsequent delay in the provisioning and recognition of losses by the institution. In conducting this assessment, competent authorities may use peer analysis and benchmark portfolios, where available. Competent authorities may also use sampling of loans when assessing portfolio credit quality. Performing exposures\n\n207.

To assess the potential impact of credit risk on the institution, competent authorities should also consider the level and quality of guarantees (including credit derivatives) and of available collateral that would mitigate credit losses where credit events occur, including those not accepted as eligible credit risk mitigation techniques for own funds calculations.\n\n213. 3. Specifically, competent authorities should consider: a. the coverage provided by collateral and guarantees by portfolio, borrower type, rating, sector and other relevant aspects; b. collateral values, for performing and non-performing exposures, including to what degree they meet the requirements of the EBA Guidelines on management of non- performing and forborne exposures (for collateral used to secure non-performing exposures) and EBA Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring (for all collateral); c. historical recovery ratios by type and amount of collateral and guarantees; and d. the materiality of the dilution risk (see Article 4 of Regulation (EU) 575/2013) for purchased receivables.\n\n214. Competent authorities should also assess the materiality of the residual risk (see Article 80 of Directive 2013/36/EU) and in particular: a. the adequacy and enforceability of collateral agreements and of guarantees; b. the timing and the ability to realise collateral and execute guarantees under the national legal framework; c. the liquidity and volatility in asset values for collateral; d. the recoverable value of collateral under any credit enforcement actions (e.g. foreclosure procedures); and e. where relevant, the guarantors' creditworthiness following the requirements of the EBA Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring.\n\n215. Competent authorities should also assess the concentration of guarantors and collateral, as well as the correlation with borrowers' creditworthiness (i.e. wrong-way risk) and the potential impact in terms of the effectiveness of protection. 87 Assessment of the level of loan loss provisions and credit valuation adjustments\n\n216. Competent authorities should assess whether the level of loan loss provisions and credit valuation adjustments are appropriate for the quality of the exposures and, where relevant, for the level of collateral. Competent authorities should assess: a. whether the level of loan loss provisions is consistent with the level of risk in different portfolios, over time and compared with the institution's relevant peers; b. whether the credit valuation adjustments to derivatives' market values reflect the creditworthiness of relevant counterparties; c. whether accounting loan loss provisions are in line with applicable accounting principles and are assessed as sufficient to cover expected losses; d. whether non-performing, forborne exposures and foreclosed assets have been subject to sufficient loan loss provisions, taking into account the level of existing collateral and the vintage of such exposures and applicable legal requirements for the minimum loss coverage of non-performing exposures; and e. whether loan loss provisions are consistent with historical losses and relevant macroeconomic developments and reflect any changes to relevant regulations (e.g. foreclosure, repossession, creditor protection, etc.).\n\n217. Where deemed necessary, competent authorities should use on-site inspections or other appropriate supervisory actions to assess whether or not the level of loan loss provisioning and risk coverage is adequate, by assessing a sample of loans, for example.\n\n218. Competent authorities should also take into consideration any findings raised by internal and external auditors, where available. Stress testing\n\n219. When evaluating the inherent credit risk of an institution, competent authorities should take into account the results of stress tests performed by the institution to identify any previously unidentified sources of credit risk, such as those emerging from changes in credit quality, credit concentrations, collateral value and credit exposure during a stressed period.",

    "paragraph_b_text": "19.While it is important to ensure legal certainty of the CRM techniques, especially when they are recognised in the calculation of own funds requirements, the EBA recognises that assessing legal certainty may be challenging, in particular in cases where the collateral has the form of a movable physical asset. The GL provide principles for institutions on how to achieve a sufficient level of legal certainty while avoiding excessive burden and unjustified costs. In particular, the GL specify a minimum list of jurisdictions that should be considered relevant for a given physical collateral other than immovable property, and for which the legal opinion should be provided. In addition, institutions should consider whether for a given collateral there are also other jurisdictions that should be considered relevant.\n\n20. The list of jurisdictions that should be considered relevant includes the jurisdiction where it is most likely that the realisation of the collateral would be carried out, should this be necessary. While in some cases it may not be easy to foresee the place of realisation of collateral, the choice of this most likely jurisdiction could be based on one of the following considerations: · contractual specification of the location to which the obligor is obliged to move the collateral in the event of non-payment; · legal obligation of the obligor to move the collateral to a location specified by the creditor, stemming from international regulations or conventions; · previous experience with regard to realising collateral of the same type; . in cases such as leasing exposures, where the asset is owned by the institution, the most likely choice of the institution. In some cases, it may be difficult to specify just one jurisdiction where the potential realisation of collateral would take place. In such case, where there are two or more jurisdictions where the realisation of collateral is equally likely, institutions should include jurisdictions considered relevant, as specified in paragraph 23(e) of the GL.\n\n21.It should be noted that the GL do not require a separate legal opinion for each relevant jurisdiction. Where possible, institutions may rely on a single legal opinion covering several jurisdictions. This may be possible in particular in those cases where international regulations have been adopted that provide a robust international framework enforcing creditors' rights over their collateral. Such regulations would typically have a form of an international convention that has been adopted or confirmed by a number of jurisdictions. The assessment based on 11 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT RISK MITIGATION EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY international regulations should therefore include a clear identification of whether these regulations cover all jurisdictions relevant for a given collateral and an assessment of whether they ensure legal effectiveness and enforceability of the collateral, as well as the types of collateral that are subject to the regulations.",

    "paragraph_b_text": "199. Generally, these exposures tend to be of a significant size relative to the portfolio and so represent a source of credit concentration, of long maturity, which makes it difficult to make reliable projections of profitability.\n\n200. In assessing the specialised lending exposures, where they are considered material,, competent authorities should consider: a. the profitability of the projects and the conservativeness of the assumptions underlying the business plans (including the credit risk of the main customers); b. the impact of changes in regulation, especially for subsidised sectors, on future cash flows; c. the impact of changing market demand, where relevant, and the existence of a market for the potential future sale of the object financed; d. the existence of a syndicate or of other lenders sharing the credit risk; and e. any form of guarantee pledged by the sponsors. Equity risk in the banking book\n\n201. Competent authorities should assess the risk of decline in the value of the institution's equity investments and ensure that this risk is appropriately captured by the institution's risk framework. Such an assessment should particularly focus, where relevant, on participation risk in strategic holdings (both insurance and non-insurance). Real-estate risk\n\n202. Competent authorities should assess the risk of decline in the value of the institution's real estate investments and ensure that this risk is appropriately captured by the institution's risk framework. Such an assessment should also focus, where relevant, on the value of financial instruments linked to real estate assets (e.g. real estate investment trusts, REITs). Model risk for regulatory approved models\n\n203. In cases where institutions are using regulatory approved internal models for the purpose of calculating own funds requirements for credit risk, competent authorities should monitor whether the institution continues to fulfil the minimum requirements and ensure that related own funds requirements are not underestimated. The assessment of model risk may be based on the insights gained in other supervisory actions, including those carried out in accordance with Article 101 of Directive 2013/36/EU. 84 Assessment of the portfolio credit quality\n\n204. In assessing inherent credit risk, competent authorities should consider the quality of the credit portfolio, by carrying out an analysis to distinguish between performing, non-performing and forborne exposure categories, taking into account requirements of the EBA Guidelines on management of non-performing and forborne exposures33.\n\n205. Competent authorities should assess the overall credit quality at portfolio level and the different quality grades within each of the above categories to determine the institution's overall credit risk. As part of this assessment competent authorities should analyse default and migration risk by exposure classes, taking into account trends in the credit quality over time, and they should consider whether the actual credit quality is consistent with the stated risk appetite, and establish reasons for any deviations.\n\n206. When assessing portfolio credit quality, competent authorities should pay particular attention to the adequacy of the classification of credit exposures and assess the impact of potential misclassification, with the subsequent delay in the provisioning and recognition of losses by the institution. In conducting this assessment, competent authorities may use peer analysis and benchmark portfolios, where available. Competent authorities may also use sampling of loans when assessing portfolio credit quality. Performing exposures\n\n207. In evaluating the credit quality of performing exposures, competent authorities should consider the change in the portfolio in terms of composition, size and creditworthiness, its profitability and the risk of future deterioration, by analysing the following elements, where available: a. borrowers' credit grade distribution (e.g. by internal and/or external ratings or other information suitable for measuring creditworthiness, such as leverage ratio, ratio of revenues devoted to the payment of instalments, etc.); b. growth rates by types of borrowers, sectors and products and consistency with credit risk strategies; c. sensitivity of borrowers' credit grades, or more generally of borrowers' repayment capacities, to the economic cycle; d. historical migration rates across credit grades, delinquency and default rates for different time horizons; and e. profitability (e.g. credit spread vs. credit losses).",

The assessment of any financial difficulties on the part of a borrower should be based on the situation of the borrower only, disregarding collateral or any guarantees provided by third parties.

In performing these analyses, competent authorities should consider both the number of obligors and the relevant amounts/volumes and take into account the level of portfolio concentration. Forborne exposures\n\n209. Competent authorities should assess the extent of forborne exposures, and the potential losses that may stem from them. As a minimum, this should include: a. the forbearance rates per portfolio and changes over time, also compared to peers; b. the forbearance rates for different types of forbearance measures, including time horizons of the measures; c. the level and quality of collateralisation of forborne exposures; and d. the migration rates of forborne exposures to performing and non-performing exposures, also compared with peers. Non-performing exposures\n\n210. Competent authorities should assess the materiality of non-performing exposures, including per portfolio and the potential losses that may stem from them. As a minimum, this should include: a. the non-performing rates and coverage per portfolio, sector, geography and changes over time, also taking into account the changes in the portfolios (e.g. growing portfolios vs expiring portfolios) and strategy with regard to non- performing exposures (e.g. recent sales of non-performing exposures); b. the distribution of the exposures across classes of non-performing exposures (i.e. past-due, doubtful, etc.); c. the types and values of collateral, where relevant; d. the migration rates from non-performing classes to performing, forborne exposures, and across non-performing classes; e. foreclosed assets and changes over time; f. historical recovery rates by portfolio, sector, geography or type of collateral and the duration of the recovery process; and g. the time since exposures were classified as non-performing, analysed by time buckets (vintage). 86\n\n211. In conducting the above analysis, competent authorities should employ peer analysis and use benchmark portfolios (i.e. portfolios of borrowers common to groups of institutions) where appropriate and possible. Assessment of the level and quality of credit risk mitigation\n\n212. To assess the potential impact of credit risk on the institution, competent authorities should also consider the level and quality of guarantees (including credit derivatives) and of available collateral that would mitigate credit losses where credit events occur, including those not accepted as eligible credit risk mitigation techniques for own funds calculations.\n\n213. 3. Specifically, competent authorities should consider: a. the coverage provided by collateral and guarantees by portfolio, borrower type, rating, sector and other relevant aspects; b. collateral values, for performing and non-performing exposures, including to what degree they meet the requirements of the EBA Guidelines on management of non- performing and forborne exposures (for collateral used to secure non-performing exposures) and EBA Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring (for all collateral); c. historical recovery ratios by type and amount of collateral and guarantees; and d. the materiality of the dilution risk (see Article 4 of Regulation (EU) 575/2013) for purchased receivables.\n\n214. Competent authorities should also assess the materiality of the residual risk (see Article 80 of Directive 2013/36/EU) and in particular: a. the adequacy and enforceability of collateral agreements and of guarantees; b. the timing and the ability to realise collateral and execute guarantees under the national legal framework; c. the liquidity and volatility in asset values for collateral; d. the recoverable value of collateral under any credit enforcement actions (e.g. foreclosure procedures); and e. where relevant, the guarantors' creditworthiness following the requirements of the EBA Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring.\n\n215. Competent authorities should also assess the concentration of guarantors and collateral, as well as the correlation with borrowers' creditworthiness (i.e. wrong-way risk) and the potential impact in terms of the effectiveness of protection. 87 Assessment of the level of loan loss provisions and credit valuation adjustments\n\n216. Competent authorities should assess whether the level of loan loss provisions and credit valuation adjustments are appropriate for the quality of the exposures and, where relevant, for the level of collateral. Competent authorities should assess: a. whether the level of loan loss provisions is consistent with the level of risk in different portfolios, over time and compared with the institution's relevant peers; b. whether the credit valuation adjustments to derivatives' market values reflect the creditworthiness of relevant counterparties; c. whether accounting loan loss provisions are in line with applicable accounting principles and are assessed as sufficient to cover expected losses; d. whether non-performing, forborne exposures and foreclosed assets have been subject to sufficient loan loss provisions, taking into account the level of existing collateral and the vintage of such exposures and applicable legal requirements for the minimum loss coverage of non-performing exposures; and e. whether loan loss provisions are consistent with historical losses and relevant macroeconomic developments and reflect any changes to relevant regulations (e.g. foreclosure, repossession, creditor protection, etc.).\n\n217. Where deemed necessary, competent authorities should use on-site inspections or other appropriate supervisory actions to assess whether or not the level of loan loss provisioning and risk coverage is adequate, by assessing a sample of loans, for example.\n\n218. Competent authorities should also take into consideration any findings raised by internal and external auditors, where available. Stress testing\n\n219. When evaluating the inherent credit risk of an institution, competent authorities should take into account the results of stress tests performed by the institution to identify any previously unidentified sources of credit risk, such as those emerging from changes in credit quality, credit concentrations, collateral value and credit exposure during a stressed period.",

    "paragraph_b_text": "19.While it is important to ensure legal certainty of the CRM techniques, especially when they are recognised in the calculation of own funds requirements, the EBA recognises that assessing legal certainty may be challenging, in particular in cases where the collateral has the form of a movable physical asset. The GL provide principles for institutions on how to achieve a sufficient level of legal certainty while avoiding excessive burden and unjustified costs. In particular, the GL specify a minimum list of jurisdictions that should be considered relevant for a given physical collateral other than immovable property, and for which the legal opinion should be provided. In addition, institutions should consider whether for a given collateral there are also other jurisdictions that should be considered relevant.\n\n20. The list of jurisdictions that should be considered relevant includes the jurisdiction where it is most likely that the realisation of the collateral would be carried out, should this be necessary. While in some cases it may not be easy to foresee the place of realisation of collateral, the choice of this most likely jurisdiction could be based on one of the following considerations: · contractual specification of the location to which the obligor is obliged to move the collateral in the event of non-payment; · legal obligation of the obligor to move the collateral to a location specified by the creditor, stemming from international regulations or conventions; · previous experience with regard to realising collateral of the same type; . in cases such as leasing exposures, where the asset is owned by the institution, the most likely choice of the institution. In some cases, it may be difficult to specify just one jurisdiction where the potential realisation of collateral would take place. In such case, where there are two or more jurisdictions where the realisation of collateral is equally likely, institutions should include jurisdictions considered relevant, as specified in paragraph 23(e) of the GL.\n\n21.It should be noted that the GL do not require a separate legal opinion for each relevant jurisdiction. Where possible, institutions may rely on a single legal opinion covering several jurisdictions. This may be possible in particular in those cases where international regulations have been adopted that provide a robust international framework enforcing creditors' rights over their collateral. Such regulations would typically have a form of an international convention that has been adopted or confirmed by a number of jurisdictions. The assessment based on 11 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT RISK MITIGATION EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY international regulations should therefore include a clear identification of whether these regulations cover all jurisdictions relevant for a given collateral and an assessment of whether they ensure legal effectiveness and enforceability of the collateral, as well as the types of collateral that are subject to the regulations.",

In performing these analyses, competent authorities should consider both the number of obligors and the relevant amounts/volumes and take into account the level of portfolio concentration. Forborne exposures\n\n209. Competent authorities should assess the extent of forborne exposures, and the potential losses that may stem from them. As a minimum, this should include: a. the forbearance rates per portfolio and changes over time, also compared to peers; b. the forbearance rates for different types of forbearance measures, including time horizons of the measures; c. the level and quality of collateralisation of forborne exposures; and d. the migration rates of forborne exposures to performing and non-performing exposures, also compared with peers. Non-performing exposures\n\n210. Competent authorities should assess the materiality of non-performing exposures, including per portfolio and the potential losses that may stem from them. As a minimum, this should include: a. the non-performing rates and coverage per portfolio, sector, geography and changes over time, also taking into account the changes in the portfolios (e.g. growing portfolios vs expiring portfolios) and strategy with regard to non- performing exposures (e.g. recent sales of non-performing exposures); b. the distribution of the exposures across classes of non-performing exposures (i.e. past-due, doubtful, etc.); c. the types and values of collateral, where relevant; d. the migration rates from non-performing classes to performing, forborne exposures, and across non-performing classes; e. foreclosed assets and changes over time; f. historical recovery rates by portfolio, sector, geography or type of collateral and the duration of the recovery process; and g. the time since exposures were classified as non-performing, analysed by time buckets (vintage). 86\n\n211. In conducting the above analysis, competent authorities should employ peer analysis and use benchmark portfolios (i.e. portfolios of borrowers common to groups of institutions) where appropriate and possible. Assessment of the level and quality of credit risk mitigation\n\n212. To assess the potential impact of credit risk on the institution, competent authorities should also consider the level and quality of guarantees (including credit derivatives) and of available collateral that would mitigate credit losses where credit events occur, including those not accepted as eligible credit risk mitigation techniques for own funds calculations.\n\n213. 3. Specifically, competent authorities should consider: a. the coverage provided by collateral and guarantees by portfolio, borrower type, rating, sector and other relevant aspects; b. collateral values, for performing and non-performing exposures, including to what degree they meet the requirements of the EBA Guidelines on management of non- performing and forborne exposures (for collateral used to secure non-performing exposures) and EBA Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring (for all collateral); c. historical recovery ratios by type and amount of collateral and guarantees; and d. the materiality of the dilution risk (see Article 4 of Regulation (EU) 575/2013) for purchased receivables.\n\n214. Competent authorities should also assess the materiality of the residual risk (see Article 80 of Directive 2013/36/EU) and in particular: a. the adequacy and enforceability of collateral agreements and of guarantees; b. the timing and the ability to realise collateral and execute guarantees under the national legal framework; c. the liquidity and volatility in asset values for collateral; d. the recoverable value of collateral under any credit enforcement actions (e.g. foreclosure procedures); and e. where relevant, the guarantors' creditworthiness following the requirements of the EBA Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring.\n\n215. Competent authorities should also assess the concentration of guarantors and collateral, as well as the correlation with borrowers' creditworthiness (i.e. wrong-way risk) and the potential impact in terms of the effectiveness of protection. 87 Assessment of the level of loan loss provisions and credit valuation adjustments\n\n216. Competent authorities should assess whether the level of loan loss provisions and credit valuation adjustments are appropriate for the quality of the exposures and, where relevant, for the level of collateral. Competent authorities should assess: a. whether the level of loan loss provisions is consistent with the level of risk in different portfolios, over time and compared with the institution's relevant peers; b. whether the credit valuation adjustments to derivatives' market values reflect the creditworthiness of relevant counterparties; c. whether accounting loan loss provisions are in line with applicable accounting principles and are assessed as sufficient to cover expected losses; d. whether non-performing, forborne exposures and foreclosed assets have been subject to sufficient loan loss provisions, taking into account the level of existing collateral and the vintage of such exposures and applicable legal requirements for the minimum loss coverage of non-performing exposures; and e. whether loan loss provisions are consistent with historical losses and relevant macroeconomic developments and reflect any changes to relevant regulations (e.g. foreclosure, repossession, creditor protection, etc.).\n\n217. Where deemed necessary, competent authorities should use on-site inspections or other appropriate supervisory actions to assess whether or not the level of loan loss provisioning and risk coverage is adequate, by assessing a sample of loans, for example.\n\n218. Competent authorities should also take into consideration any findings raised by internal and external auditors, where available. Stress testing\n\n219. When evaluating the inherent credit risk of an institution, competent authorities should take into account the results of stress tests performed by the institution to identify any previously unidentified sources of credit risk, such as those emerging from changes in credit quality, credit concentrations, collateral value and credit exposure during a stressed period.",

Competent authorities may also use sampling of loans when assessing portfolio credit quality. Performing exposures\n\n207. In evaluating the credit quality of performing exposures, competent authorities should consider the change in the portfolio in terms of composition, size and creditworthiness, its profitability and the risk of future deterioration, by analysing the following elements, where available: a. borrowers' credit grade distribution (e.g. by internal and/or external ratings or other information suitable for measuring creditworthiness, such as leverage ratio, ratio of revenues devoted to the payment of instalments, etc.); b. growth rates by types of borrowers, sectors and products and consistency with credit risk strategies; c. sensitivity of borrowers' credit grades, or more generally of borrowers' repayment capacities, to the economic cycle; d. historical migration rates across credit grades, delinquency and default rates for different time horizons; and e. profitability (e.g. credit spread vs. credit losses).",
    "paragraph_b_text": "208. In performing these analyses, competent authorities should consider both the number of obligors and the relevant amounts/volumes and take into account the level of portfolio concentration. Forborne exposures\n\n209. Competent authorities should assess the extent of forborne exposures, and the potential losses that may stem from them. As a minimum, this should include: a. the forbearance rates per portfolio and changes over time, also compared to peers; b. the forbearance rates for different types of forbearance measures, including time horizons of the measures; c. the level and quality of collateralisation of forborne exposures; and d. the migration rates of forborne exposures to performing and non-performing exposures, also compared with peers. Non-performing exposures\n\n210. Competent authorities should assess the materiality of non-performing exposures, including per portfolio and the potential losses that may stem from them. As a minimum, this should include: a. the non-performing rates and coverage per portfolio, sector, geography and changes over time, also taking into account the changes in the portfolios (e.g. growing portfolios vs expiring portfolios) and strategy with regard to non- performing exposures (e.g. recent sales of non-performing exposures); b. the distribution of the exposures across classes of non-performing exposures (i.e. past-due, doubtful, etc.); c. the types and values of collateral, where relevant; d. the migration rates from non-performing classes to performing, forborne exposures, and across non-performing classes; e. foreclosed assets and changes over time; f. historical recovery rates by portfolio, sector, geography or type of collateral and the duration of the recovery process; and g. the time since exposures were classified as non-performing, analysed by time buckets (vintage). 86\n\n211. In conducting the above analysis, competent authorities should employ peer analysis and use benchmark portfolios (i.e. portfolios of borrowers common to groups of institutions) where appropriate and possible. Assessment of the level and quality of credit risk mitigation\n\n212. To assess the potential impact of credit risk on the institution, competent authorities should also consider the level and quality of guarantees (including credit derivatives) and of available collateral that would mitigate credit losses where credit events occur, including those not accepted as eligible credit risk mitigation techniques for own funds calculations.\n\n213. 3. Specifically, competent authorities should consider: a. the coverage provided by collateral and guarantees by portfolio, borrower type, rating, sector and other relevant aspects; b. collateral values, for performing and non-performing exposures, including to what degree they meet the requirements of the EBA Guidelines on management of non- performing and forborne exposures (for collateral used to secure non-performing exposures) and EBA Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring (for all collateral); c. historical recovery ratios by type and amount of collateral and guarantees; and d. the materiality of the dilution risk (see Article 4 of Regulation (EU) 575/2013) for purchased receivables.\n\n214. Competent authorities should also assess the materiality of the residual risk (see Article 80 of Directive 2013/36/EU) and in particular: a. the adequacy and enforceability of collateral agreements and of guarantees; b. the timing and the ability to realise collateral and execute guarantees under the national legal framework; c. the liquidity and volatility in asset values for collateral; d. the recoverable value of collateral under any credit enforcement actions (e.g. foreclosure procedures); and e. where relevant, the guarantors' creditworthiness following the requirements of the EBA Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring.\n\n215. Competent authorities should also assess the concentration of guarantors and collateral, as well as the correlation with borrowers' creditworthiness (i.e. wrong-way risk) and the potential impact in terms of the effectiveness of protection. 87 Assessment of the level of loan loss provisions and credit valuation adjustments\n\n216. Competent authorities should assess whether the level of loan loss provisions and credit valuation adjustments are appropriate for the quality of the exposures and, where relevant, for the level of collateral. Competent authorities should assess: a. whether the level of loan loss provisions is consistent with the level of risk in different portfolios, over time and compared with the institution's relevant peers; b. whether the credit valuation adjustments to derivatives' market values reflect the creditworthiness of relevant counterparties; c. whether accounting loan loss provisions are in line with applicable accounting principles and are assessed as sufficient to cover expected losses; d. whether non-performing, forborne exposures and foreclosed assets have been subject to sufficient loan loss provisions, taking into account the level of existing collateral and the vintage of such exposures and applicable legal requirements for the minimum loss coverage of non-performing exposures; and e. whether loan loss provisions are consistent with historical losses and relevant macroeconomic developments and reflect any changes to relevant regulations (e.g. foreclosure, repossession, creditor protection, etc.).\n\n217. Where deemed necessary, competent authorities should use on-site inspections or other appropriate supervisory actions to assess whether or not the level of loan loss provisioning and risk coverage is adequate, by assessing a sample of loans, for example.\n\n218. Competent authorities should also take into consideration any findings raised by internal and external auditors, where available. Stress testing\n\n219. When evaluating the inherent credit risk of an institution, competent authorities should take into account the results of stress tests performed by the institution to identify any previously unidentified sources of credit risk, such as those emerging from changes in credit quality, credit concentrations, collateral value and credit exposure during a stressed period.",

The GL provide principles for institutions on how to achieve a sufficient level of legal certainty while avoiding excessive burden and unjustified costs. In particular, the GL specify a minimum list of jurisdictions that should be considered relevant for a given physical collateral other than immovable property, and for which the legal opinion should be provided. In addition, institutions should consider whether for a given collateral there are also other jurisdictions that should be considered relevant.\n\n20. The list of jurisdictions that should be considered relevant includes the jurisdiction where it is most likely that the realisation of the collateral would be carried out, should this be necessary. While in some cases it may not be easy to foresee the place of realisation of collateral, the choice of this most likely jurisdiction could be based on one of the following considerations: · contractual specification of the location to which the obligor is obliged to move the collateral in the event of non-payment; · legal obligation of the obligor to move the collateral to a location specified by the creditor, stemming from international regulations or conventions; · previous experience with regard to realising collateral of the same type; . in cases such as leasing exposures, where the asset is owned by the institution, the most likely choice of the institution. In some cases, it may be difficult to specify just one jurisdiction where the potential realisation of collateral would take place. In such case, where there are two or more jurisdictions where the realisation of collateral is equally likely, institutions should include jurisdictions considered relevant, as specified in paragraph 23(e) of the GL.\n\n21.It should be noted that the GL do not require a separate legal opinion for each relevant jurisdiction. Where possible, institutions may rely on a single legal opinion covering several jurisdictions. This may be possible in particular in those cases where international regulations have been adopted that provide a robust international framework enforcing creditors' rights over their collateral. Such regulations would typically have a form of an international convention that has been adopted or confirmed by a number of jurisdictions. The assessment based on 11 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT RISK MITIGATION EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY international regulations should therefore include a clear identification of whether these regulations cover all jurisdictions relevant for a given collateral and an assessment of whether they ensure legal effectiveness and enforceability of the collateral, as well as the types of collateral that are subject to the regulations.",

As a minimum, this should include: a. the forbearance rates per portfolio and changes over time, also compared to peers; b. the forbearance rates for different types of forbearance measures, including time horizons of the measures; c. the level and quality of collateralisation of forborne exposures; and d. the migration rates of forborne exposures to performing and non-performing exposures, also compared with peers. Non-performing exposures\n\n210. Competent authorities should assess the materiality of non-performing exposures, including per portfolio and the potential losses that may stem from them. As a minimum, this should include: a. the non-performing rates and coverage per portfolio, sector, geography and changes over time, also taking into account the changes in the portfolios (e.g. growing portfolios vs expiring portfolios) and strategy with regard to non- performing exposures (e.g. recent sales of non-performing exposures); b. the distribution of the exposures across classes of non-performing exposures (i.e. past-due, doubtful, etc.); c. the types and values of collateral, where relevant; d. the migration rates from non-performing classes to performing, forborne exposures, and across non-performing classes; e. foreclosed assets and changes over time; f. historical recovery rates by portfolio, sector, geography or type of collateral and the duration of the recovery process; and g. the time since exposures were classified as non-performing, analysed by time buckets (vintage). 86\n\n211. In conducting the above analysis, competent authorities should employ peer analysis and use benchmark portfolios (i.e. portfolios of borrowers common to groups of institutions) where appropriate and possible. Assessment of the level and quality of credit risk mitigation\n\n212. To assess the potential impact of credit risk on the institution, competent authorities should also consider the level and quality of guarantees (including credit derivatives) and of available collateral that would mitigate credit losses where credit events occur, including those not accepted as eligible credit risk mitigation techniques for own funds calculations.\n\n213. 3. Specifically, competent authorities should consider: a. the coverage provided by collateral and guarantees by portfolio, borrower type, rating, sector and other relevant aspects; b. collateral values, for performing and non-performing exposures, including to what degree they meet the requirements of the EBA Guidelines on management of non- performing and forborne exposures (for collateral used to secure non-performing exposures) and EBA Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring (for all collateral); c. historical recovery ratios by type and amount of collateral and guarantees; and d. the materiality of the dilution risk (see Article 4 of Regulation (EU) 575/2013) for purchased receivables.\n\n214. Competent authorities should also assess the materiality of the residual risk (see Article 80 of Directive 2013/36/EU) and in particular: a. the adequacy and enforceability of collateral agreements and of guarantees; b. the timing and the ability to realise collateral and execute guarantees under the national legal framework; c. the liquidity and volatility in asset values for collateral; d. the recoverable value of collateral under any credit enforcement actions (e.g. foreclosure procedures); and e. where relevant, the guarantors' creditworthiness following the requirements of the EBA Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring.\n\n215. Competent authorities should also assess the concentration of guarantors and collateral, as well as the correlation with borrowers' creditworthiness (i.e. wrong-way risk) and the potential impact in terms of the effectiveness of protection. 87 Assessment of the level of loan loss provisions and credit valuation adjustments\n\n216. Competent authorities should assess whether the level of loan loss provisions and credit valuation adjustments are appropriate for the quality of the exposures and, where relevant, for the level of collateral. Competent authorities should assess: a. whether the level of loan loss provisions is consistent with the level of risk in different portfolios, over time and compared with the institution's relevant peers; b. whether the credit valuation adjustments to derivatives' market values reflect the creditworthiness of relevant counterparties; c. whether accounting loan loss provisions are in line with applicable accounting principles and are assessed as sufficient to cover expected losses; d. whether non-performing, forborne exposures and foreclosed assets have been subject to sufficient loan loss provisions, taking into account the level of existing collateral and the vintage of such exposures and applicable legal requirements for the minimum loss coverage of non-performing exposures; and e. whether loan loss provisions are consistent with historical losses and relevant macroeconomic developments and reflect any changes to relevant regulations (e.g. foreclosure, repossession, creditor protection, etc.).\n\n217. Where deemed necessary, competent authorities should use on-site inspections or other appropriate supervisory actions to assess whether or not the level of loan loss provisioning and risk coverage is adequate, by assessing a sample of loans, for example.\n\n218. Competent authorities should also take into consideration any findings raised by internal and external auditors, where available. Stress testing\n\n219. When evaluating the inherent credit risk of an institution, competent authorities should take into account the results of stress tests performed by the institution to identify any previously unidentified sources of credit risk, such as those emerging from changes in credit quality, credit concentrations, collateral value and credit exposure during a stressed period.",

    "paragraph_b_text": "19.While it is important to ensure legal certainty of the CRM techniques, especially when they are recognised in the calculation of own funds requirements, the EBA recognises that assessing legal certainty may be challenging, in particular in cases where the collateral has the form of a movable physical asset. The GL provide principles for institutions on how to achieve a sufficient level of legal certainty while avoiding excessive burden and unjustified costs. In particular, the GL specify a minimum list of jurisdictions that should be considered relevant for a given physical collateral other than immovable property, and for which the legal opinion should be provided. In addition, institutions should consider whether for a given collateral there are also other jurisdictions that should be considered relevant.\n\n20. The list of jurisdictions that should be considered relevant includes the jurisdiction where it is most likely that the realisation of the collateral would be carried out, should this be necessary. While in some cases it may not be easy to foresee the place of realisation of collateral, the choice of this most likely jurisdiction could be based on one of the following considerations: · contractual specification of the location to which the obligor is obliged to move the collateral in the event of non-payment; · legal obligation of the obligor to move the collateral to a location specified by the creditor, stemming from international regulations or conventions; · previous experience with regard to realising collateral of the same type; . in cases such as leasing exposures, where the asset is owned by the institution, the most likely choice of the institution. In some cases, it may be difficult to specify just one jurisdiction where the potential realisation of collateral would take place. In such case, where there are two or more jurisdictions where the realisation of collateral is equally likely, institutions should include jurisdictions considered relevant, as specified in paragraph 23(e) of the GL.\n\n21.It should be noted that the GL do not require a separate legal opinion for each relevant jurisdiction. Where possible, institutions may rely on a single legal opinion covering several jurisdictions. This may be possible in particular in those cases where international regulations have been adopted that provide a robust international framework enforcing creditors' rights over their collateral. Such regulations would typically have a form of an international convention that has been adopted or confirmed by a number of jurisdictions. The assessment based on 11 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT RISK MITIGATION EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY international regulations should therefore include a clear identification of whether these regulations cover all jurisdictions relevant for a given collateral and an assessment of whether they ensure legal effectiveness and enforceability of the collateral, as well as the types of collateral that are subject to the regulations.",

The review process and frequency should be specific and proportionate to the type and risk profile of the borrower and the type, size and complexity of the credit facility, and should be specified in relevant policies and procedures. Institutions should carry out more frequent reviews if they identify a deterioration in the credit and asset quality. The overall credit risk monitoring framework and data infrastructure should allow institutions to verify that regular credit reviews have been performed in accordance with the credit risk policies and procedures, and for the identification of any outliers/exceptions to be flagged for follow up.\n\n259. To this end, institutions should also, if appropriate, periodically update relevant financial information on the borrower and assess the new information against the creditworthiness assessment criteria established in accordance with Section 4.3 of these guidelines. The collection and assessment of this information should support the institution in recognising the early warning signs of declining credit quality.\n\n260. Institutions should carry out periodic reviews for the purposes of the assessment of the borrower's risk of default and the potential need for the migration between risk categories and grades.\n\n261. Borrowers' credit reviews should include an assessment of existing debt and borrowers' sensitivity to external factors, such as foreign exchange rate volatility, if relevant, that may affect the size of debt and repayment capacity, also in line with the sensitivity analysis requirements, as specified in Section 5.2.6.\n\n262. Institutions should assess risks associated with the refinancing of existing debt, monitoring loans with bullet/balloon repayment terms separately from other loans on a regular basis. They should analyse potential effects on a borrower's inability to roll over/refinance existing debt, and include inter alia a forward-looking macroeconomic outlook and access to capital markets as well as other types of debt structures. Institutions should closely monitor the borrowers' ability to repay or refinance their debts throughout a loan's lifecycle and not just when the borrower is approaching the end of a loan's term.\n\n263. A regular credit risk review should take into consideration both the individual and the total risk profile of the exposure, including relevant macroeconomic factors and specific economic sectors or activities and how the repayment capacity may be affected by these factors.\n\n264.

In addition to monitoring credit and financial metrics, institutions should take into account information related to qualitative factors that could have a relevant influence on the repayment of a loan.

When assessing the adequacy of the allowances credit institutions should take into account relevant factors and expectations at the reporting date that may affect the collectability of remaining cash flows over the life of a group of lending exposures or a single lending exposure. Credit institutions should consider information which goes beyond historical and current data, and take into account reasonable and supportable forward-looking information, including macroeconomic factors, that are relevant to the exposure(s) being evaluated (for example retail or wholesale) in accordance with the applicable accounting framework.\n\n59. Depending on the ability to incorporate forward-looking information into the ECL estimate, credit institutions may use individual or collective assessment approaches; regardless of the assessment approach used, they should be consistent with the relevant accounting requirements and not result in materially different allowance measurements. Together, individual and collective assessments form the basis for the allowance for ECL.\n\n60. The ECL assessment approach used should be the most appropriate in the particular circumstances, and typically should be aligned with how the credit institution manages the lending exposure. For example, collective assessment is often used for large groups of homogeneous lending exposures with shared credit risk characteristics, such as retail portfolios. Individual assessments are often conducted for significant exposures, or where credit concerns have been identified at the individual loan level, such as watch list and past due loans. 30 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT INSTITUTIONS' CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND ACCOUNTING FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY\n\n61. Regardless of the assessment approach it uses (individual or collective), a credit institution should ensure this does not result in delayed recognition of ECL.\n\n62. When credit institutions use individual assessments, the ECL estimate should always incorporate the expected impact of all reasonable and supportable forward-looking information, including macroeconomic factors, that affect collectability and credit risk. When applying an individual assessment approach, in the same manner as in the case of collective assessment, the credit institution's documentation should clearly demonstrate how forward- looking information, including macroeconomic factors, has been reflected in the individual assessment.\n\n63. In cases when a credit institution's individual assessments of exposures do not adequately consider forward-looking information, and in order to allow identification of relationships between forward-looking information and ECL estimates that may not be apparent at the individual level, an institution should group lending exposures with shared credit risk characteristics to estimate the impact of forward-looking information, including macroeconomic factors. Conversely, when credit institutions determine that all reasonable and supportable forward-looking information has been incorporated in the individual assessment of ECL, an additional forward-looking assessment should not be conducted on a collective basis if that could result in double counting.",

    "paragraph_b_text": "27. IFRS 9 includes a number of practical expedients, intended to ease the implementation burden for a wide range of companies in recognition of the fact that IFRS 9 will be used by a variety of entities, including entities outside the banking industry.\n\n128. The paragraphs below address the following practical expedients: the information set which an entity must consider in measuring ECL; the exception for 'low' credit risk exposures; and the 30-days-past-due rebuttable presumption.\n\n129. Credit institutions should make limited use of those practical expedients as they have the potential to introduce significant bias and because - given their business - the cost of obtaining the relevant information is not likely to involve 'undue cost or effort'. Credit institutions should consider the need to make adjustments when using practical expedients to avoid any resulting bias, as they should take into account that the objective of IFRS 9 is to estimate expected credit losses to reflect an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes (IFRS 9, paragraph 5.5.17).\n\n130. Where a credit institution uses such practical expedients, justifications for the use of practical expedients should be clearly documented by the credit institution. 46 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT INSTITUTIONS' CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND ACCOUNTING FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY The information set\n\n131. IFRS 9, paragraph B5.5.15, states that 'an entity shall consider reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost and effort' and that 'an entity need not undertake an exhaustive search for information when determining whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition'. Credit institutions should not read these statements restrictively and should develop systems and processes that use all reasonable and supportable information that is relevant to the group of exposures or individual exposure, as needed to achieve a high-quality, robust and consistent implementation of the accounting requirements. Nevertheless, additional cost and operational burden do not need to be introduced where they do not contribute to a high- quality implementation of IFRS 9. 'Low credit risk' exemption\n\n132. In accordance with paragraph 5.5.10 of IFRS 9, 'an entity may assume that the credit risk on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the financial instrument is determined to have a low credit risk at the reporting date'. Although credit institutions thus have the option for 'low credit risk' exposures not to assess whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, use of this exemption should be limited. In particular, credit institutions should conduct timely assessment of significant increases in credit risk for all lending exposures.\n\n133. In that context, credit institutions should always recognise changes in 12-month ECL through the allowance where there is not a significant increase in credit risk and move lending exposures to lifetime ECL measurement, if there is a significant increase in credit risk. In order to achieve a high-quality implementation of IFRS 9, any use of the low-credit-risk exemption should be accompanied by clear evidence that credit risk as of the reporting date is sufficiently low that a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition could not have occurred.\n\n134. To illustrate the meaning of low credit risk in IFRS 9, paragraph B5.5.22, IFRS 9, paragraph B5.5.23, cites as an example an instrument with an external 'investment grade' rating. However, all lending exposures that have an 'investment grade' rating from a credit rating agency cannot automatically be considered low credit risk. Credit institutions should rely primarily on their own credit risk assessments in order to evaluate the credit risk of a lending exposure, and not rely solely or mechanistically on ratings provided by credit rating agencies (where the latter are available). Nevertheless, optimistic internal credit ratings, as compared with external ratings, should require additional analysis and justification by a credit institution's management body or senior management. More-than-30-days-past-due rebuttable presumption\n\n135. Credit institutions should have credit risk assessment and management processes in place to ensure that significant credit risk increases are detected well ahead of exposures becoming 47 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT INSTITUTIONS' CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND ACCOUNTING FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY past due or delinquent. Although the use of the more-than-30-days-past-due rebuttable presumption as a backstop measure is not precluded in accordance with IFRS 9 alongside other, earlier indicators for assessing significant increase in credit risk, credit institutions should avoid using it as a primary indicator of transfer to lifetime ECL.\n\n136. Any assertion that the more-than-30-days-past-due presumption is rebutted on the basis that there has not been a significant increase in credit risk should be accompanied by a thorough analysis clearly demonstrating that 30 days past due is not correlated with a significant increase in credit risk32. Such analysis should consider both current and reasonable and supportable forward-looking information that may cause future cash shortfalls to differ from historical experience.\n\n137. In this regard, credit institutions should use relevant forward-looking information that is reasonable and supportable to analyse whether there is any substantive relationship between such information and credit risk drivers. Credit institutions should not use the 30-days-past- due rebuttable presumption unless they have demonstrated that the forward-looking information had no substantive relationship with the credit risk driver or such information is not available without undue cost or effort.\n\n138. . In the limited instances where past-due information is the best criterion available to a credit institution to determine when exposures should move to the lifetime ECL category, credit institutions should pay particular attention to their measurement of 12-month ECL allowance to ensure that ECL are appropriately captured in accordance with the measurement objective of IFRS 9. Moreover, credit institutions should take into account that significant reliance on backward-looking information will introduce bias into the implementation of an ECL accounting model and that they should ensure that the objectives of the IFRS 9 impairment requirements (i.e. to reflect ECL that meet the stated measurement objectives and to capture all significant increases in credit risk) are met.",

IFRS 9 includes a number of practical expedients, intended to ease the implementation burden for a wide range of companies in recognition of the fact that IFRS 9 will be used by a variety of entities, including entities outside the banking industry.\n\n128. The paragraphs below address the following practical expedients: the information set which an entity must consider in measuring ECL; the exception for 'low' credit risk exposures; and the 30-days-past-due rebuttable presumption.\n\n129. Credit institutions should make limited use of those practical expedients as they have the potential to introduce significant bias and because - given their business - the cost of obtaining the relevant information is not likely to involve 'undue cost or effort'. Credit institutions should consider the need to make adjustments when using practical expedients to avoid any resulting bias, as they should take into account that the objective of IFRS 9 is to estimate expected credit losses to reflect an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes (IFRS 9, paragraph 5.5.17).\n\n130. Where a credit institution uses such practical expedients, justifications for the use of practical expedients should be clearly documented by the credit institution. 46 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT INSTITUTIONS' CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND ACCOUNTING FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY The information set\n\n131. IFRS 9, paragraph B5.5.15, states that 'an entity shall consider reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost and effort' and that 'an entity need not undertake an exhaustive search for information when determining whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition'. Credit institutions should not read these statements restrictively and should develop systems and processes that use all reasonable and supportable information that is relevant to the group of exposures or individual exposure, as needed to achieve a high-quality, robust and consistent implementation of the accounting requirements. Nevertheless, additional cost and operational burden do not need to be introduced where they do not contribute to a high- quality implementation of IFRS 9. 'Low credit risk' exemption\n\n132. In accordance with paragraph 5.5.10 of IFRS 9, 'an entity may assume that the credit risk on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the financial instrument is determined to have a low credit risk at the reporting date'. Although credit institutions thus have the option for 'low credit risk' exposures not to assess whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, use of this exemption should be limited. In particular, credit institutions should conduct timely assessment of significant increases in credit risk for all lending exposures.\n\n133. In that context, credit institutions should always recognise changes in 12-month ECL through the allowance where there is not a significant increase in credit risk and move lending exposures to lifetime ECL measurement, if there is a significant increase in credit risk. In order to achieve a high-quality implementation of IFRS 9, any use of the low-credit-risk exemption should be accompanied by clear evidence that credit risk as of the reporting date is sufficiently low that a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition could not have occurred.\n\n134. To illustrate the meaning of low credit risk in IFRS 9, paragraph B5.5.22, IFRS 9, paragraph B5.5.23, cites as an example an instrument with an external 'investment grade' rating. However, all lending exposures that have an 'investment grade' rating from a credit rating agency cannot automatically be considered low credit risk. Credit institutions should rely primarily on their own credit risk assessments in order to evaluate the credit risk of a lending exposure, and not rely solely or mechanistically on ratings provided by credit rating agencies (where the latter are available). Nevertheless, optimistic internal credit ratings, as compared with external ratings, should require additional analysis and justification by a credit institution's management body or senior management. More-than-30-days-past-due rebuttable presumption\n\n135. Credit institutions should have credit risk assessment and management processes in place to ensure that significant credit risk increases are detected well ahead of exposures becoming 47 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT INSTITUTIONS' CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND ACCOUNTING FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY past due or delinquent. Although the use of the more-than-30-days-past-due rebuttable presumption as a backstop measure is not precluded in accordance with IFRS 9 alongside other, earlier indicators for assessing significant increase in credit risk, credit institutions should avoid using it as a primary indicator of transfer to lifetime ECL.\n\n136. Any assertion that the more-than-30-days-past-due presumption is rebutted on the basis that there has not been a significant increase in credit risk should be accompanied by a thorough analysis clearly demonstrating that 30 days past due is not correlated with a significant increase in credit risk32. Such analysis should consider both current and reasonable and supportable forward-looking information that may cause future cash shortfalls to differ from historical experience.\n\n137. In this regard, credit institutions should use relevant forward-looking information that is reasonable and supportable to analyse whether there is any substantive relationship between such information and credit risk drivers. Credit institutions should not use the 30-days-past- due rebuttable presumption unless they have demonstrated that the forward-looking information had no substantive relationship with the credit risk driver or such information is not available without undue cost or effort.\n\n138. . In the limited instances where past-due information is the best criterion available to a credit institution to determine when exposures should move to the lifetime ECL category, credit institutions should pay particular attention to their measurement of 12-month ECL allowance to ensure that ECL are appropriately captured in accordance with the measurement objective of IFRS 9. Moreover, credit institutions should take into account that significant reliance on backward-looking information will introduce bias into the implementation of an ECL accounting model and that they should ensure that the objectives of the IFRS 9 impairment requirements (i.e. to reflect ECL that meet the stated measurement objectives and to capture all significant increases in credit risk) are met.",

IFRS 9, paragraph B5.5.15, states that 'an entity shall consider reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost and effort' and that 'an entity need not undertake an exhaustive search for information when determining whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition'. Credit institutions should not read these statements restrictively and should develop systems and processes that use all reasonable and supportable information that is relevant to the group of exposures or individual exposure, as needed to achieve a high-quality, robust and consistent implementation of the accounting requirements. Nevertheless, additional cost and operational burden do not need to be introduced where they do not contribute to a high- quality implementation of IFRS 9. 'Low credit risk' exemption\n\n132. In accordance with paragraph 5.5.10 of IFRS 9, 'an entity may assume that the credit risk on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the financial instrument is determined to have a low credit risk at the reporting date'. Although credit institutions thus have the option for 'low credit risk' exposures not to assess whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, use of this exemption should be limited. In particular, credit institutions should conduct timely assessment of significant increases in credit risk for all lending exposures.\n\n133. In that context, credit institutions should always recognise changes in 12-month ECL through the allowance where there is not a significant increase in credit risk and move lending exposures to lifetime ECL measurement, if there is a significant increase in credit risk. In order to achieve a high-quality implementation of IFRS 9, any use of the low-credit-risk exemption should be accompanied by clear evidence that credit risk as of the reporting date is sufficiently low that a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition could not have occurred.\n\n134. To illustrate the meaning of low credit risk in IFRS 9, paragraph B5.5.22, IFRS 9, paragraph B5.5.23, cites as an example an instrument with an external 'investment grade' rating. However, all lending exposures that have an 'investment grade' rating from a credit rating agency cannot automatically be considered low credit risk. Credit institutions should rely primarily on their own credit risk assessments in order to evaluate the credit risk of a lending exposure, and not rely solely or mechanistically on ratings provided by credit rating agencies (where the latter are available).

Because of this understanding, the level at which downturn LGDs are calibrated should be at least the same as the level at which long-run average LGDs are calculated for the purpose of calibration. In this context, it should be recalled that the GL on PD and LGD estimation define the notion of 'calibration segments' as a uniquely identified subset of the range of application of the LGD model that is jointly calibrated. The use of calibration segments does not, however, require institutions to calibrate LGDs at the level of calibration segments. Institutions may use calibration segments but calibrate LGD estimates at the level of each grade or pool (e.g. if, in the step of calibration, the portfolio under consideration is split by certain regions) within those calibration segments. However, regardless of whether an institution calculates the long- run average LGD at the level of calibration segments or at the level of grades or pools, both with the objective of providing LGD estimates by facility grade or pool, the quantification of downturn LGD estimates should follow the level considered by the institution for the purpose of calibrating LGD estimates to the long-run average LGD.\n\n5. In line with the aspects covered by the CRR in the context of quantification of risk parameters, these GL provide, in addition, requirements on MoC related to downturn LGD estimation. Issues of representativeness have not been addressed, as these are covered by subsection 4.2.4 of the GL on PD and LGD estimation.

To the extent that LGD estimates take into account the existence of unfunded credit protection institutions should specify the criteria and methodology for recognising and including in their LGD estimates the protection in the form of guarantees and credit derivatives that meet the criteria specified in Article 60 of the RTS on IRB assessment methodology.\n\n126. Institutions should take into account as a risk driver or segmentation criterion information on all main types of collaterals that are used within the scope of application of the LGD model. Institutions should clearly define in their internal policies the main and other types of collaterals used for the type of exposures covered by the rating system and should ensure that, to the extent that LGD estimates take into account the existence of collateral, the policies regarding the management of these types of collateral comply with the requirement of Article 181(1)(f) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. Institutions should specify the main types of collaterals in such a way that the cash flows from the remaining types of collaterals will not significantly bias the estimation of recoveries that are realised without the use of collaterals.\n\n127. 7. Collaterals which do not meet the requirement of Article 181(1)(f) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 cannot be included as a risk driver in the LGD estimation and the cash flows received from those collaterals should be treated as if they had been received without the use of collaterals. Regardless of this treatment in the LGD estimation, institutions should collect the information about the source of the cash flows related to those collaterals and allocate them as related to those collaterals. Institutions should regularly monitor the levels of such cash flows as well as the extent to which the relevant types of collaterals are used.

However, in 38% of LGD models, the downturn period value is used for all model components (22%), or for the most relevant components (16%). In 23% of LGD models, a fixed downturn adjustment is applied, and in 9% of models the LGD estimation is based on data from the downturn period without using model components.\n\n245. Around 17% of respondents indicate that they use conservatism in the model development process to reflect downturn LGD estimates. In terms of the regulatory environment, the baseline scenario for downturn LGD estimates is set out by the currently applicable Guidelines on the implementation, validation and assessment of 53 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Advanced Measurement (AMA) and Internal Ratings Based (IRB) Approaches (GL 10) published by the Committee of European Banking Supervisors in April 2006. Those previous guidelines define appropriate downturn conditions as those in which relevant drivers of default rates are consistent with conditions in which credit losses for the supervisory exposure class are expected to be substantially higher than average. This framework put an emphasis on the correlation between default rates and recovery rates; in fact, if no material dependencies between default rates and recovery rates are identified, the downturn LGD estimates may be based on the long-run average LGD. D. Options considered This section presents the assessment of the technical options considered in the guidelines. Under each option, the potential advantages and disadvantages of the options are discussed together with potential costs and benefits. Since most of the alternatives are presented in explanatory text for the consultation, this section refers to these explanations. Specification of the level of application of the downturn Paragraph 14 requires institutions to provide a downturn LGD estimate at least at the same level as the one considered for long-run average LGD in LGD calibration. The report on IRB modelling highlights a significant variability of practices Findings from the IRB survey on the variety of methodologies Figure 52: At which level is the downturn adjustment specified?",
    "paragraph_b_text": "1. The European Banking Authority (EBA) has previously outlined its programme on the review of the IRB approach in the EBA's report and opinion on the implementation of the regulatory review of the IRB approach published in February 2016.1 After (i) reviewing supervisory practices, (ii) harmonising the definition of default and (iii) providing more clarity on how to model probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and defaulted exposures, including the estimation of downturn LGD, the credit risk mitigation (CRM) framework constitutes the fourth and last phase of this programme. Although these guidelines (GL) were not originally envisaged as part of the review, the need for these GL has been identified in the course of work aiming to clarify the CRM framework in the context of the advanced IRB (A-IRB) approach.2 They thereby complement the EBA's report on the credit risk mitigation framework3 (the CRM report), which was focused on the standardised approach (SA) and the foundation IRB (F-IRB) approach.\n\n2.

However, in 38% of LGD models, the downturn period value is used for all model components (22%), or for the most relevant components (16%). In 23% of LGD models, a fixed downturn adjustment is applied, and in 9% of models the LGD estimation is based on data from the downturn period without using model components.\n\n245. Around 17% of respondents indicate that they use conservatism in the model development process to reflect downturn LGD estimates. In terms of the regulatory environment, the baseline scenario for downturn LGD estimates is set out by the currently applicable Guidelines on the implementation, validation and assessment of 53 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Advanced Measurement (AMA) and Internal Ratings Based (IRB) Approaches (GL 10) published by the Committee of European Banking Supervisors in April 2006. Those previous guidelines define appropriate downturn conditions as those in which relevant drivers of default rates are consistent with conditions in which credit losses for the supervisory exposure class are expected to be substantially higher than average. This framework put an emphasis on the correlation between default rates and recovery rates; in fact, if no material dependencies between default rates and recovery rates are identified, the downturn LGD estimates may be based on the long-run average LGD. D. Options considered This section presents the assessment of the technical options considered in the guidelines. Under each option, the potential advantages and disadvantages of the options are discussed together with potential costs and benefits. Since most of the alternatives are presented in explanatory text for the consultation, this section refers to these explanations. Specification of the level of application of the downturn Paragraph 14 requires institutions to provide a downturn LGD estimate at least at the same level as the one considered for long-run average LGD in LGD calibration.

The European Banking Authority (EBA) has previously outlined its programme on the review of the IRB approach in the EBA's report and opinion on the implementation of the regulatory review of the IRB approach published in February 2016.1 After (i) reviewing supervisory practices, (ii) harmonising the definition of default and (iii) providing more clarity on how to model probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and defaulted exposures, including the estimation of downturn LGD, the credit risk mitigation (CRM) framework constitutes the fourth and last phase of this programme. Although these guidelines (GL) were not originally envisaged as part of the review, the need for these GL has been identified in the course of work aiming to clarify the CRM framework in the context of the advanced IRB (A-IRB) approach.2 They thereby complement the EBA's report on the credit risk mitigation framework3 (the CRM report), which was focused on the standardised approach (SA) and the foundation IRB (F-IRB) approach.\n\n2.

They should do so by establishing a framework that consists of the following phases: (a) identification of deficiencies of implementation of the model in the IT system or application of risk parameters; (b) specification of the form of conservatism to be applied and quantification of the appropriate level of conservatism; (c) monitoring of the deficiencies and correcting them; (d) documentation.\n\n196. For the purpose of paragraph 195(a) institutions should have a robust process for identifying all implementation and application deficiencies in the assignment process, whereby each deficiency leads to additional conservative treatment in the affected assignment to a grade or pool. Institutions should consider at least the following triggers for additional conservatism: (a) missing data in the application portfolio; 96 GUIDELINES ON PD ESTIMATION, LGD ESTIMATION AND TREATMENT DEFAULTED EXPOSURES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY (b) missing updates of financial statements or credit bureau data as referred to in paragraph 59(h); (c) outdated ratings in the application portfolio; where outdated rating should be understood as specified in Article 25(2)(b) of the RTS on IRB methodology; (d) missing ratings, whereby an exposure is considered as being within the scope of application of the IRB model but is not rated by it.\n\n197. For the purpose of paragraph 195(b) institutions should ensure that the occurrence of any of the triggers referred to in paragraph 196 results in the application of additional conservatism to the risk parameter for the purpose of the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts. Where more than one trigger occurs, the estimate should be more conservative. The additional conservatism related to each trigger should be proportionate to the uncertainty in the estimated risk parameter introduced by the trigger.\n\n198.

However, this does not mean that enhanced due diligence measures should be automatically applied to the counterparty.\n\n(210) According to the FIN-FSA's interpretation, if a supervised entity intends to enter into correspondent banking relationships, it shall, as part of the procedures referred to in chapter 2, section 3(2), prepare risk-based approaches to be followed in the correspondent banking relationship to obtain adequate information, including procedures to comply with the enhanced due diligence obligation.\n\n(211) The FIN-FSA recommends that, in correspondent banking relationships with counterparties domiciled within the EEA, the supervised entity, applying a risk-based approach: · obtains adequate information on the counterparty to understand what its business consists of and to ensure that the counterparty has effective procedures to ensure compliance with AML/CFT regulations · assesses the reputation of the counterparty based on publicly available information · assesses the quality of supervision targeted at the supervised entity · carefully identifies the beneficial owners and owners of the counterparty and assesses the risks pertaining to its ownership structure.",

GUIDELINE (paragraphs 209-211)\n\n(209) According to the FIN-FSA's interpretation, chapter 3, section 10(1) of the AML Act means that a supervised entity may, based on the assessment of risks related to a correspondent banking relationship, come to the conclusion that enhanced due diligence measures are required in respect of the counterparty even though it is established in the EEA. 42 Example: An indication of elevated risk could be, for example, if the counterparty is located in an EEA member state which is placed on a list maintained by the FATF of countries with strategic deficiencies in their regimes to counter and investigate money laundering and terrorist financing and which have prepared an action plan with the FATF to eliminate these deficiencies43. However, this does not mean that enhanced due diligence measures should be automatically applied to the counterparty.\n\n(210) According to the FIN-FSA's interpretation, if a supervised entity intends to enter into correspondent banking relationships, it shall, as part of the procedures referred to in chapter 2, section 3(2), prepare risk-based approaches to be followed in the correspondent banking relationship to obtain adequate information, including procedures to comply with the enhanced due diligence obligation.\n\n(211) The FIN-FSA recommends that, in correspondent banking relationships with counterparties domiciled within the EEA, the supervised entity, applying a risk-based approach: · obtains adequate information on the counterparty to understand what its business consists of and to ensure that the counterparty has effective procedures to ensure compliance with AML/CFT regulations · assesses the reputation of the counterparty based on publicly available information · assesses the quality of supervision targeted at the supervised entity · carefully identifies the beneficial owners and owners of the counterparty and assesses the risks pertaining to its ownership structure.",

However, this does not mean that enhanced due diligence measures should be automatically applied to the counterparty.\n\n(210) According to the FIN-FSA's interpretation, if a supervised entity intends to enter into correspondent banking relationships, it shall, as part of the procedures referred to in chapter 2, section 3(2), prepare risk-based approaches to be followed in the correspondent banking relationship to obtain adequate information, including procedures to comply with the enhanced due diligence obligation.\n\n(211) The FIN-FSA recommends that, in correspondent banking relationships with counterparties domiciled within the EEA, the supervised entity, applying a risk-based approach: · obtains adequate information on the counterparty to understand what its business consists of and to ensure that the counterparty has effective procedures to ensure compliance with AML/CFT regulations · assesses the reputation of the counterparty based on publicly available information · assesses the quality of supervision targeted at the supervised entity · carefully identifies the beneficial owners and owners of the counterparty and assesses the risks pertaining to its ownership structure.",

GUIDELINE (paragraphs 209-211)\n\n(209) According to the FIN-FSA's interpretation, chapter 3, section 10(1) of the AML Act means that a supervised entity may, based on the assessment of risks related to a correspondent banking relationship, come to the conclusion that enhanced due diligence measures are required in respect of the counterparty even though it is established in the EEA. 42 Example: An indication of elevated risk could be, for example, if the counterparty is located in an EEA member state which is placed on a list maintained by the FATF of countries with strategic deficiencies in their regimes to counter and investigate money laundering and terrorist financing and which have prepared an action plan with the FATF to eliminate these deficiencies43. However, this does not mean that enhanced due diligence measures should be automatically applied to the counterparty.\n\n(210) According to the FIN-FSA's interpretation, if a supervised entity intends to enter into correspondent banking relationships, it shall, as part of the procedures referred to in chapter 2, section 3(2), prepare risk-based approaches to be followed in the correspondent banking relationship to obtain adequate information, including procedures to comply with the enhanced due diligence obligation.\n\n(211) The FIN-FSA recommends that, in correspondent banking relationships with counterparties domiciled within the EEA, the supervised entity, applying a risk-based approach: · obtains adequate information on the counterparty to understand what its business consists of and to ensure that the counterparty has effective procedures to ensure compliance with AML/CFT regulations · assesses the reputation of the counterparty based on publicly available information · assesses the quality of supervision targeted at the supervised entity · carefully identifies the beneficial owners and owners of the counterparty and assesses the risks pertaining to its ownership structure.",

GUIDELINE (paragraphs 209-211)\n\n(209) According to the FIN-FSA's interpretation, chapter 3, section 10(1) of the AML Act means that a supervised entity may, based on the assessment of risks related to a correspondent banking relationship, come to the conclusion that enhanced due diligence measures are required in respect of the counterparty even though it is established in the EEA. 42 Example: An indication of elevated risk could be, for example, if the counterparty is located in an EEA member state which is placed on a list maintained by the FATF of countries with strategic deficiencies in their regimes to counter and investigate money laundering and terrorist financing and which have prepared an action plan with the FATF to eliminate these deficiencies43. However, this does not mean that enhanced due diligence measures should be automatically applied to the counterparty.\n\n(210) According to the FIN-FSA's interpretation, if a supervised entity intends to enter into correspondent banking relationships, it shall, as part of the procedures referred to in chapter 2, section 3(2), prepare risk-based approaches to be followed in the correspondent banking relationship to obtain adequate information, including procedures to comply with the enhanced due diligence obligation.\n\n(211) The FIN-FSA recommends that, in correspondent banking relationships with counterparties domiciled within the EEA, the supervised entity, applying a risk-based approach: · obtains adequate information on the counterparty to understand what its business consists of and to ensure that the counterparty has effective procedures to ensure compliance with AML/CFT regulations · assesses the reputation of the counterparty based on publicly available information · assesses the quality of supervision targeted at the supervised entity · carefully identifies the beneficial owners and owners of the counterparty and assesses the risks pertaining to its ownership structure.",

However, this does not mean that enhanced due diligence measures should be automatically applied to the counterparty.\n\n(210) According to the FIN-FSA's interpretation, if a supervised entity intends to enter into correspondent banking relationships, it shall, as part of the procedures referred to in chapter 2, section 3(2), prepare risk-based approaches to be followed in the correspondent banking relationship to obtain adequate information, including procedures to comply with the enhanced due diligence obligation.\n\n(211) The FIN-FSA recommends that, in correspondent banking relationships with counterparties domiciled within the EEA, the supervised entity, applying a risk-based approach: · obtains adequate information on the counterparty to understand what its business consists of and to ensure that the counterparty has effective procedures to ensure compliance with AML/CFT regulations · assesses the reputation of the counterparty based on publicly available information · assesses the quality of supervision targeted at the supervised entity · carefully identifies the beneficial owners and owners of the counterparty and assesses the risks pertaining to its ownership structure.",
