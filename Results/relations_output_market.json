    "paragraph_a_text": "21.Based on this, the EBA understands that assets at fair value constitute a category that should always be included in the perimeter of CSRBB. This is in line with the current GL and also has practical evidence. This also provides a minimum harmonisation in the definition of the perimeter.\n\n22.However, the EBA considers that CSRBB exposures should not be confined upfront to these categories only. Indeed, and despite the perimeter in the current EBA GL, banks report other categories as exposed to CSRBB in practice and therefore banks should pay attention to all potential exposures to CSRBB irrespective of the asset or liability category they are. For these reasons the EBA opts for Policy option B for the definition of the perimeter.\n\n23.As regards the definition of CSRBB itself, the EBA considers that idiosyncratic elements should not be included since they are generally covered in other risk framework, mainly the credit risk. Considering these elements in the definition could trigger double counting issues. Also from a conceptual perspective, CSRBB is purely market related and therefore market and liquidity related elements should conform its definition. Nevertheless, after accounting for proportionality aspects and the qualitative QIS input mentioned in the previous item, the GL envisage some flexibility in the treatment of idiosyncratic elements, as long as the results would become more conservative. This is a good balance in the implementation between the pure definition of CSRBB and the operational difficulties that some banks might find in disentangling the idiosyncratic elements of credit spread risk. 62 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF INTEREST RATE RISK AND CREDIT SPREAD RISK ARISING FROM NON- TRADING BOOK ACTIVITIES",
