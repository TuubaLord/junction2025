GUIDELINE (paragraphs 7-10)\n\n(7) The FIN-FSA recommends that regulations 4-5 are also complied with by supervised entities excluded from the authority to issue regulations under paragraph 1.\n\n(8) The FIN-FSA recommends that paragraph 6 is also complied with by supervised entities other than those mentioned in paragraph 6, where the arrangement of IT-systems based sanctions screening shall be considered commensurate with respect to the nature, extent and size of the supervised entity's activities.

The information received from the monitoring shall be reported on a regular basis to the persons responsible within the supervised entity's organisation and where necessary, to the operative management and board of directors of the supervised entity.\n\n(10) The FIN-FSA recommends the supervised entity to use algorithm-based techniques, (so-called fuzzy logic) in sanctions screening, if the supervised entity is using an IT systems-based solution for sanctions screening. The objective is to detect sanctioned parties whose name can be spelled in multiple ways by identifying name pairs which are not identical but whose spelling, structure or pronunciation are very similar. Example: The supervised entity has a customer whose first name is Alexander. Names that are not identical with the customer's name but whose spelling, structure or pronunciation are very similar, include, for example, Alexandr, Alexandre, Oleksander and Oleksandr.",

For example, the provision of financial services may involve prohibitions or restrictions under sanctions regulation. In particular, in the context of trade finance services, it is necessary to ensure that the transactions are not violating sanctions regulation and do not seek to evade sanctions regulation. Example: A supervised entity provides an export letter of credit for a customer's transaction related to Kazakhstan. The supervised entity's customer exports goods to its new customer in Kazakhstan. The goods have been determined as dual-use items, and their exports to Russia are prohibited under valid sanctions regulation. The supervised entity must ensure that the transaction does not directly or indirectly involve sanctioned parties and that the transaction does not seek to evade sanctions regulation in any other way, for example so that the ultimate recipient of the goods is in Russia.31\n\n(38) The FIN-FSA recommends that, in sanctions screening concerning payments and other transactions, the supervised entity applies enhancement lists used in addition to official sanctions lists, naming for example parties that are owned for more than 50% or controlled by sanctioned parties.\n\n(39) The FIN-FSA recommends that the supervised entity's sanctions screening of payments and transactions covers address information in addition to names, so that any countries and geographical areas subject to comprehensive sanctions can be identified.",

In order to monitor that gender-neutral remuneration policies are applied, institutions should document appropriately the value of the position, e.g. by documenting job descriptions or defining wage categories, for all staff members or categories of staff and determine which positions are considered as having an equal value, e.g. by implementing a job classification system, taking into account at least the type of activities, tasks and duties assigned to the position or staff member. Where a job classification system is used for determining pay, it should be based on the same criteria for men, women and staff of diverse genders and drawn up so as to exclude any discrimination, including on grounds of gender.\n\n27.Institutions may consider in a gender-neutral manner additional aspects when determining the remuneration of staff. Such aspects may include: a. educational, professional and training requirements, skills, effort and responsibility, work undertaken and the nature of tasks involved14; b. the place of employment and its costs of living; c. the hierarchical level of staff and if staff have managerial responsibilities; d. the level of formal education of staff; e. the scarcity of staff available in the labour market for specialised positions; f. the nature of the employment contract, including if it is temporary or a contract with an indefinite period; g. the length of professional experience of staff; h. professional certifications of staff; i. appropriate benefits, including the payment of additional household and child allowances to staff with spouses and dependent family members.",

The goods have been determined as dual-use items, and their exports to Russia are prohibited under valid sanctions regulation.

GUIDELINE (paragraphs 4-5)\n\n(4) According to the FIN-FSA's interpretation, ensuring the effective policies, procedures and internal control referred to in chapter 3, section 16 of the AML Act requires that the supervised entity has first prepared a risk assessment, in which it identifies and assesses the risks of non-compliance with sanctions regulation and national freezing orders it is exposed to, as well as their probabilities.\n\n(5) According to the FIN-FSA's interpretation, the effective policies, procedures and internal control referred to in chapter 3, section 16 of the AML Act shall be commensurate with the risks identified in the risk assessment. The supervised entity may apply a risk-based approach in determining how to allocate resources to ensuring compliance with sanctions regulation and national freezing orders. However, in doing so it must be ensured that the supervised entity has adequate resources in all areas of its operation to ensure that sanctions regulation and national freezing orders are complied with in all respects. Risk-based discretion may not be applied as to whether the supervised entity complies with sanctions regulation and national freezing orders in all respects. Example 1: Based on a sanctions risk assessment prepared by a supervised entity, the supervised entity has assessed that the comprehensive sanctions imposed on Russia will have an effect elevating the risk associated with its activities. Applying a risk-based approach, the supervised entity allocates more resources on the areas of its operation which are the most vulnerable to sanctions imposed on Russia. Among other things, the supervised entity scrutinises Russian payment traffic on an enhanced basis (including the background and purpose of payments) with respect to customers that have payments to/ from Russia.",

    "paragraph_b_text": "(16) Sections 5 and 7(2) of the Freezing Act define assets which are excluded from national freezing orders. GUIDELINE (paragraph 17)\n\n(17) The FIN-FSA recommends supervised entities to consider that the annexes under sanctions regulation determine the competent authority in each member state which may grant derogations from the prohibitions referred to in the relevant sanctions regulation. In Finland, the competent authority is the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Example: Sanctions are imposed on a Finnish citizen, person X, in an EU sanctions regulation binding on Finland. Person X has a housing loan, amortised by monthly instalments to the bank. Person X also has home insurance, which is payable on a quarterly basis, and an investment policy paid on a monthly basis. Furthermore, X receives an employee pension. The abovementioned EU sanctions regulation enables the national competent authority to grant permission to unfreeze certain frozen funds or other economic resources or to make certain funds or economic resources available. The precondition is that the funds or economic resources are necessary to satisfy the basic needs of the sanctioned party. Basic needs include, among other things, payments for foodstuffs, rent or mortgage, medicines and medical treatment, taxes, insurance premiums, and public utility charges. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs has, at person X's application, granted person X a derogation to satisfy basic needs, which covers housing loan instalments and home insurance premiums. Before the bank takes receipt of a housing loan instalment, it checks the contents of the derogation presented by person X and saves it in customer's KYC-file. The insurance company also acts accordingly and accepts the home insurance premiums. In contrast, the investment insurance policy is excluded from the scope of the derogation, and the insurance company does not accept related payments. The employee pension company seeks a derogation from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs for the payment of employee pension. In connection with the payment of the pension, the employee pension company may also need to provide the derogation to its own bank so that the bank can ascertain that the funds may be transferred to the recipient of pension despite person X being subject to EU sanctions.

GUIDELINE (paragraphs 4-5)\n\n(4) According to the FIN-FSA's interpretation, ensuring the effective policies, procedures and internal control referred to in chapter 3, section 16 of the AML Act requires that the supervised entity has first prepared a risk assessment, in which it identifies and assesses the risks of non-compliance with sanctions regulation and national freezing orders it is exposed to, as well as their probabilities.\n\n(5) According to the FIN-FSA's interpretation, the effective policies, procedures and internal control referred to in chapter 3, section 16 of the AML Act shall be commensurate with the risks identified in the risk assessment. The supervised entity may apply a risk-based approach in determining how to allocate resources to ensuring compliance with sanctions regulation and national freezing orders. However, in doing so it must be ensured that the supervised entity has adequate resources in all areas of its operation to ensure that sanctions regulation and national freezing orders are complied with in all respects. Risk-based discretion may not be applied as to whether the supervised entity complies with sanctions regulation and national freezing orders in all respects. Example 1: Based on a sanctions risk assessment prepared by a supervised entity, the supervised entity has assessed that the comprehensive sanctions imposed on Russia will have an effect elevating the risk associated with its activities. Applying a risk-based approach, the supervised entity allocates more resources on the areas of its operation which are the most vulnerable to sanctions imposed on Russia. Among other things, the supervised entity scrutinises Russian payment traffic on an enhanced basis (including the background and purpose of payments) with respect to customers that have payments to/ from Russia.",

GUIDELINE (paragraphs 4-5)\n\n(4) According to the FIN-FSA's interpretation, ensuring the effective policies, procedures and internal control referred to in chapter 3, section 16 of the AML Act requires that the supervised entity has first prepared a risk assessment, in which it identifies and assesses the risks of non-compliance with sanctions regulation and national freezing orders it is exposed to, as well as their probabilities.\n\n(5) According to the FIN-FSA's interpretation, the effective policies, procedures and internal control referred to in chapter 3, section 16 of the AML Act shall be commensurate with the risks identified in the risk assessment. The supervised entity may apply a risk-based approach in determining how to allocate resources to ensuring compliance with sanctions regulation and national freezing orders. However, in doing so it must be ensured that the supervised entity has adequate resources in all areas of its operation to ensure that sanctions regulation and national freezing orders are complied with in all respects. Risk-based discretion may not be applied as to whether the supervised entity complies with sanctions regulation and national freezing orders in all respects. Example 1: Based on a sanctions risk assessment prepared by a supervised entity, the supervised entity has assessed that the comprehensive sanctions imposed on Russia will have an effect elevating the risk associated with its activities. Applying a risk-based approach, the supervised entity allocates more resources on the areas of its operation which are the most vulnerable to sanctions imposed on Russia. Among other things, the supervised entity scrutinises Russian payment traffic on an enhanced basis (including the background and purpose of payments) with respect to customers that have payments to/ from Russia.",

GUIDELINE (paragraph 17)\n\n(17) The FIN-FSA recommends supervised entities to consider that the annexes under sanctions regulation determine the competent authority in each member state which may grant derogations from the prohibitions referred to in the relevant sanctions regulation. In Finland, the competent authority is the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Example: Sanctions are imposed on a Finnish citizen, person X, in an EU sanctions regulation binding on Finland. Person X has a housing loan, amortised by monthly instalments to the bank. Person X also has home insurance, which is payable on a quarterly basis, and an investment policy paid on a monthly basis. Furthermore, X receives an employee pension. The abovementioned EU sanctions regulation enables the national competent authority to grant permission to unfreeze certain frozen funds or other economic resources or to make certain funds or economic resources available. The precondition is that the funds or economic resources are necessary to satisfy the basic needs of the sanctioned party. Basic needs include, among other things, payments for foodstuffs, rent or mortgage, medicines and medical treatment, taxes, insurance premiums, and public utility charges. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs has, at person X's application, granted person X a derogation to satisfy basic needs, which covers housing loan instalments and home insurance premiums. Before the bank takes receipt of a housing loan instalment, it checks the contents of the derogation presented by person X and saves it in customer's KYC-file. The insurance company also acts accordingly and accepts the home insurance premiums. In contrast, the investment insurance policy is excluded from the scope of the derogation, and the insurance company does not accept related payments. The employee pension company seeks a derogation from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs for the payment of employee pension. In connection with the payment of the pension, the employee pension company may also need to provide the derogation to its own bank so that the bank can ascertain that the funds may be transferred to the recipient of pension despite person X being subject to EU sanctions.

    "paragraph_a_text": "(1) In this chapter, exposure assessment of the supervised entity's activities to sanctions regulation and national freezing orders refers to a risk assessment prepared by the supervised entity in order to identify any threats and vulnerabilities it is exposed to concerning sanctions, and to assess the probabilities of the materialisation of these threats and vulnerabilities.4\n\n(2) The FIN-FSA's authority to issue more detailed regulations on the procedures to be followed in customer due diligence and the management of risks posed by customers to the activities of a supervised entity is based on the following provisions: Section 39(4) of the Payment Institutions Act, chapter 15, section 18(4) of the Credit Institutions Act, section 13(4) of the Virtual Currency Providers Act, chapter 12, section 3(4) of the Investment Services Act, chapter 12, section 10 of the AIFM Act, chapter 6, section 21(4) of the Insurance Companies Act, chapter 26, section 15(4) of the Mutual Funds Act and chapter 8, section 13 of the Act on the Book-Entry System and Settlement Operations.\n\n(3) For the purposes of regulation 6, a supervised entity refers to supervised entities falling within the scope of authority to issue regulations under paragraph 2 above. GUIDELINE (paragraphs 4-5)\n\n(4) According to the FIN-FSA's interpretation, ensuring the effective policies, procedures and internal control referred to in chapter 3, section 16 of the AML Act requires that the supervised entity has first prepared a risk assessment, in which it identifies and assesses the risks of non-compliance with sanctions regulation and national freezing orders it is exposed to, as well as their probabilities.\n\n(5) According to the FIN-FSA's interpretation, the effective policies, procedures and internal control referred to in chapter 3, section 16 of the AML Act shall be commensurate with the risks identified in the risk assessment. The supervised entity may apply a risk-based approach in determining how to allocate resources to ensuring compliance with sanctions regulation and national freezing orders. However, in doing so it must be ensured that the supervised entity has adequate resources in all areas of its operation to ensure that sanctions regulation and national freezing orders are complied with in all respects. Risk-based discretion may not be applied as to whether the supervised entity complies with sanctions regulation and national freezing orders in all respects. Example 1: Based on a sanctions risk assessment prepared by a supervised entity, the supervised entity has assessed that the comprehensive sanctions imposed on Russia will have an effect elevating the risk associated with its activities. Applying a risk-based approach, the supervised entity allocates more resources on the areas of its operation which are the most vulnerable to sanctions imposed on Russia. Among other things, the supervised entity scrutinises Russian payment traffic on an enhanced basis (including the background and purpose of payments) with respect to customers that have payments to/ from Russia.",
    "paragraph_b_text": "(16) Sections 5 and 7(2) of the Freezing Act define assets which are excluded from national freezing orders. GUIDELINE (paragraph 17)\n\n(17) The FIN-FSA recommends supervised entities to consider that the annexes under sanctions regulation determine the competent authority in each member state which may grant derogations from the prohibitions referred to in the relevant sanctions regulation. In Finland, the competent authority is the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Example: Sanctions are imposed on a Finnish citizen, person X, in an EU sanctions regulation binding on Finland. Person X has a housing loan, amortised by monthly instalments to the bank. Person X also has home insurance, which is payable on a quarterly basis, and an investment policy paid on a monthly basis. Furthermore, X receives an employee pension. The abovementioned EU sanctions regulation enables the national competent authority to grant permission to unfreeze certain frozen funds or other economic resources or to make certain funds or economic resources available. The precondition is that the funds or economic resources are necessary to satisfy the basic needs of the sanctioned party. Basic needs include, among other things, payments for foodstuffs, rent or mortgage, medicines and medical treatment, taxes, insurance premiums, and public utility charges. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs has, at person X's application, granted person X a derogation to satisfy basic needs, which covers housing loan instalments and home insurance premiums. Before the bank takes receipt of a housing loan instalment, it checks the contents of the derogation presented by person X and saves it in customer's KYC-file. The insurance company also acts accordingly and accepts the home insurance premiums. In contrast, the investment insurance policy is excluded from the scope of the derogation, and the insurance company does not accept related payments. The employee pension company seeks a derogation from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs for the payment of employee pension. In connection with the payment of the pension, the employee pension company may also need to provide the derogation to its own bank so that the bank can ascertain that the funds may be transferred to the recipient of pension despite person X being subject to EU sanctions.

    "paragraph_b_text": "6. The responsibility of the institutions' and payment institutions' management body for the institution or payment institution and all its activities can never be outsourced.\n\n7. Outsourcing is also relevant in the context of gaining or maintaining access to the EU's financial market. Third-country institutions and payment institutions may wish to set up subsidiaries or branches in the EU to get or maintain access to the EU's financial markets and infrastructures. In this context, third-country institutions and payment institutions may seek to minimise the transfer of the effective performance of business activities to their subsidiaries and branches located in the EU, e.g. by relying on the outsourcing of functions to the third-country parent institution or other third-country group entities.\n\n8. Outsourcing must not lead to a situation where an institution or a payment institution becomes an 'empty shell' that lacks the substance to remain authorised. To this end, the management body should ensure that sufficient resources are available to appropriately support and ensure the performance of its responsibilities, including overseeing the risks and managing the outsourcing arrangements.\n\n9. Functions that are considered critical under a resolution perspective may also be outsourced. Outsourcing arrangements should not create impediments to the resolvability of the institution.\n\n10.Competent authorities must grant authorisation in full compliance with Union law; should set a strict framework, in line with these guidelines, on outsourcing by institutions and payment institutions in the EU to third-country entities; and should ensure consistent and effective supervision. Competent authorities should also ensure that institutions and payment institutions have policies and procedures in place to comply with the relevant framework at all times.\n\n11.Institutions and payment institutions should be able to effectively control and challenge the quality and performance of outsourced functions and be able to carry out their own risk assessment and ongoing monitoring. It is not sufficient for institutions and payment institutions to undertake only formal assessments of whether or not outsourced functions meet regulatory requirements.\n\n12.The guidelines should be read in conjunction with, but without prejudice to, the EBA Guidelines on internal governance (which already include requirements on institutions' outsourcing policies), the EBA Guidelines on common procedures and methodologies for the supervisory 7 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY review and evaluation process (SREP) and the EBA Guidelines on information and communication technology (ICT) risk assessment under the SREP.\n\n13.For payment institutions, these guidelines should be read in conjunction with the EBA Guidelines on the information to be provided for the authorisation of payment institutions under Directive 2015/2366/EU3 (PSD2), the EBA Guidelines on security measures for operational and security risks under the PSD24 and EBA Guidelines on major incident reporting under the PSD2.5\n\n14.All requirements set out in these guidelines are subject to the principle of proportionality; they are to be applied in a manner that is appropriate, taking into account, in particular, the institution's or payment institution's size and internal organisation and the nature, scope and complexity of its activities. Rationale and objective of the guidelines\n\n15. The EBA is updating the CEBS guidelines on outsourcing issued in 2006, which applied exclusively to credit institutions, with the aim of establishing a more harmonised framework for the outsourcing arrangements of financial institutions. The scope of application of these guidelines covers not only credit institutions and investment firms subject to the CRD (referred to as 'institutions'), but also payment and electronic money institutions (referred to as 'payment institutions'). The guidelines are not directly addressed to credit intermediaries and non-bank creditors that are subject to Directive 2014/17/EU6 or to account information service providers that are only registered for the provision of service 8 of Annex I to the PSD2. Outsourcing arrangements between institutions, payment institutions and such entities are within the scope of the guidelines when such entities act as outsourcing service providers.\n\n16. The update of the guidelines takes into account and is consistent with the current requirements under the CRD, Directive 2014/65/EU7 (MiFID II), Directive 2009/110/EC& (Electronic Money Directive; EMD), the PSD2 and Directive 2014/59/EU9 (Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive; 3 Directive 2015/2366/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015 on payment services in the internal market, amending Directives 2002/65/EC, 2009/110/EC and 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, and repealing Directive 2007/64/EC.",

The responsibility of the institutions' and payment institutions' management body for the institution or payment institution and all its activities can never be outsourced.\n\n7. Outsourcing is also relevant in the context of gaining or maintaining access to the EU's financial market. Third-country institutions and payment institutions may wish to set up subsidiaries or branches in the EU to get or maintain access to the EU's financial markets and infrastructures. In this context, third-country institutions and payment institutions may seek to minimise the transfer of the effective performance of business activities to their subsidiaries and branches located in the EU, e.g. by relying on the outsourcing of functions to the third-country parent institution or other third-country group entities.\n\n8. Outsourcing must not lead to a situation where an institution or a payment institution becomes an 'empty shell' that lacks the substance to remain authorised. To this end, the management body should ensure that sufficient resources are available to appropriately support and ensure the performance of its responsibilities, including overseeing the risks and managing the outsourcing arrangements.\n\n9. Functions that are considered critical under a resolution perspective may also be outsourced. Outsourcing arrangements should not create impediments to the resolvability of the institution.\n\n10.Competent authorities must grant authorisation in full compliance with Union law; should set a strict framework, in line with these guidelines, on outsourcing by institutions and payment institutions in the EU to third-country entities; and should ensure consistent and effective supervision. Competent authorities should also ensure that institutions and payment institutions have policies and procedures in place to comply with the relevant framework at all times.\n\n11.Institutions and payment institutions should be able to effectively control and challenge the quality and performance of outsourced functions and be able to carry out their own risk assessment and ongoing monitoring. It is not sufficient for institutions and payment institutions to undertake only formal assessments of whether or not outsourced functions meet regulatory requirements.\n\n12.The guidelines should be read in conjunction with, but without prejudice to, the EBA Guidelines on internal governance (which already include requirements on institutions' outsourcing policies), the EBA Guidelines on common procedures and methodologies for the supervisory 7 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY review and evaluation process (SREP) and the EBA Guidelines on information and communication technology (ICT) risk assessment under the SREP.\n\n13.For payment institutions, these guidelines should be read in conjunction with the EBA Guidelines on the information to be provided for the authorisation of payment institutions under Directive 2015/2366/EU3 (PSD2), the EBA Guidelines on security measures for operational and security risks under the PSD24 and EBA Guidelines on major incident reporting under the PSD2.5\n\n14.All requirements set out in these guidelines are subject to the principle of proportionality; they are to be applied in a manner that is appropriate, taking into account, in particular, the institution's or payment institution's size and internal organisation and the nature, scope and complexity of its activities.

The EBA is updating the CEBS guidelines on outsourcing issued in 2006, which applied exclusively to credit institutions, with the aim of establishing a more harmonised framework for the outsourcing arrangements of financial institutions.

The responsibility of the institutions' and payment institutions' management body for the institution or payment institution and all its activities can never be outsourced.\n\n7. Outsourcing is also relevant in the context of gaining or maintaining access to the EU's financial market. Third-country institutions and payment institutions may wish to set up subsidiaries or branches in the EU to get or maintain access to the EU's financial markets and infrastructures. In this context, third-country institutions and payment institutions may seek to minimise the transfer of the effective performance of business activities to their subsidiaries and branches located in the EU, e.g. by relying on the outsourcing of functions to the third-country parent institution or other third-country group entities.\n\n8. Outsourcing must not lead to a situation where an institution or a payment institution becomes an 'empty shell' that lacks the substance to remain authorised. To this end, the management body should ensure that sufficient resources are available to appropriately support and ensure the performance of its responsibilities, including overseeing the risks and managing the outsourcing arrangements.\n\n9. Functions that are considered critical under a resolution perspective may also be outsourced. Outsourcing arrangements should not create impediments to the resolvability of the institution.\n\n10.Competent authorities must grant authorisation in full compliance with Union law; should set a strict framework, in line with these guidelines, on outsourcing by institutions and payment institutions in the EU to third-country entities; and should ensure consistent and effective supervision. Competent authorities should also ensure that institutions and payment institutions have policies and procedures in place to comply with the relevant framework at all times.\n\n11.Institutions and payment institutions should be able to effectively control and challenge the quality and performance of outsourced functions and be able to carry out their own risk assessment and ongoing monitoring. It is not sufficient for institutions and payment institutions to undertake only formal assessments of whether or not outsourced functions meet regulatory requirements.\n\n12.The guidelines should be read in conjunction with, but without prejudice to, the EBA Guidelines on internal governance (which already include requirements on institutions' outsourcing policies), the EBA Guidelines on common procedures and methodologies for the supervisory 7 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY review and evaluation process (SREP) and the EBA Guidelines on information and communication technology (ICT) risk assessment under the SREP.\n\n13.For payment institutions, these guidelines should be read in conjunction with the EBA Guidelines on the information to be provided for the authorisation of payment institutions under Directive 2015/2366/EU3 (PSD2), the EBA Guidelines on security measures for operational and security risks under the PSD24 and EBA Guidelines on major incident reporting under the PSD2.5\n\n14.All requirements set out in these guidelines are subject to the principle of proportionality; they are to be applied in a manner that is appropriate, taking into account, in particular, the institution's or payment institution's size and internal organisation and the nature, scope and complexity of its activities. Rationale and objective of the guidelines\n\n15. The EBA is updating the CEBS guidelines on outsourcing issued in 2006, which applied exclusively to credit institutions, with the aim of establishing a more harmonised framework for the outsourcing arrangements of financial institutions. The scope of application of these guidelines covers not only credit institutions and investment firms subject to the CRD (referred to as 'institutions'), but also payment and electronic money institutions (referred to as 'payment institutions'). The guidelines are not directly addressed to credit intermediaries and non-bank creditors that are subject to Directive 2014/17/EU6 or to account information service providers that are only registered for the provision of service 8 of Annex I to the PSD2. Outsourcing arrangements between institutions, payment institutions and such entities are within the scope of the guidelines when such entities act as outsourcing service providers.\n\n16. The update of the guidelines takes into account and is consistent with the current requirements under the CRD, Directive 2014/65/EU7 (MiFID II), Directive 2009/110/EC& (Electronic Money Directive; EMD), the PSD2 and Directive 2014/59/EU9 (Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive; 3 Directive 2015/2366/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015 on payment services in the internal market, amending Directives 2002/65/EC, 2009/110/EC and 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, and repealing Directive 2007/64/EC.",

The responsibility of the institutions' and payment institutions' management body for the institution or payment institution and all its activities can never be outsourced.\n\n7. Outsourcing is also relevant in the context of gaining or maintaining access to the EU's financial market. Third-country institutions and payment institutions may wish to set up subsidiaries or branches in the EU to get or maintain access to the EU's financial markets and infrastructures. In this context, third-country institutions and payment institutions may seek to minimise the transfer of the effective performance of business activities to their subsidiaries and branches located in the EU, e.g. by relying on the outsourcing of functions to the third-country parent institution or other third-country group entities.\n\n8. Outsourcing must not lead to a situation where an institution or a payment institution becomes an 'empty shell' that lacks the substance to remain authorised. To this end, the management body should ensure that sufficient resources are available to appropriately support and ensure the performance of its responsibilities, including overseeing the risks and managing the outsourcing arrangements.\n\n9. Functions that are considered critical under a resolution perspective may also be outsourced.

The EBA is updating the CEBS guidelines on outsourcing issued in 2006, which applied exclusively to credit institutions, with the aim of establishing a more harmonised framework for the outsourcing arrangements of financial institutions.

The guidelines are not directly addressed to credit intermediaries and non-bank creditors that are subject to Directive 2014/17/EU6 or to account information service providers that are only registered for the provision of service 8 of Annex I to the PSD2. Outsourcing arrangements between institutions, payment institutions and such entities are within the scope of the guidelines when such entities act as outsourcing service providers.\n\n16.
