Competent authorities may assess the possible change in and sensitivity of the liquidity coverage requirement following the application of Articles 412(3) and 414 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 during mild stress scenarios, by means of supervisory or institution liquidity- specific stress testing. The scenarios applied for this assessment should typically be less severe (e.g. only market-wide stress) than the scenarios used to test the survival of the institution (market-wide and systemic stress) and consequently reflect situations in which institutions would not be expected to use their minimum liquidity buffer. When performing supervisory liquidity stress testing for Category 3 and Category 4 institutions, competent authorities may use fewer scenarios and apply lower granularity of the analysis than for other institutions.",

    "paragraph_b_text": "526. To articulate the specific quantitative liquidity requirements appropriately, competent authorities should use one of the following approaches, unless another approach is considered more appropriate in specific circumstances: a. Approach 1 - require an LCR higher than the regulatory minimum, of such a size that shortcomings identified are sufficiently mitigated; b. Approach 2 - require a minimum survival period of such a length that identified shortcomings are sufficiently mitigated; the survival period can be set either directly, as a requirement, or indirectly, by setting a cap on the amount of outflows over the relevant time buckets considered; competent authorities may require different types of liquid assets (e.g. assets eligible for central banks), to cover risks not (adequately) covered by the LCR; 192 c. Approach 3 - require a minimum total amount of liquid assets or counterbalancing capacity, either as a minimum total amount or as a minimum amount in excess of the applicable regulatory minimum, of such a size that identified shortcomings are sufficiently mitigated; competent authorities may set requirements for the composition of liquid assets, including operational requirements (e.g. direct convertibility to cash, or deposit of the liquid assets at the central bank).\n\n527. To articulate the specific quantitative stable funding requirements appropriately, competent authorities should use one of the following approaches, unless another approach is considered more appropriate in specific circumstances: a. Approach 4 - require a NSFR higher than the regulatory minimum, of such a size that shortcomings identified are sufficiently mitigated; b. Approach 5 - require a minimum total amount of available stable funding, either as a minimum total amount or as a minimum amount in excess of the applicable regulatory minimum, of such a size that identified shortcomings are sufficiently mitigated.\n\n528. To ensure there is consistency, competent authorities should structure specific quantitative liquidity requirements in such a manner as to deliver broadly consistent prudential outcomes across institutions, bearing in mind that the types of requirements specified may differ between institutions because of their individual circumstances. In addition to the quantity, the structure should specify the expected composition and nature of the requirement. In all cases, it should specify the supervisory requirement and any applicable Directive 2013/36/EU requirements. Liquidity buffers and counterbalancing capacity held by the institution to meet supervisory requirements should be available for use by the institution during times of stress.\n\n529. When setting the specific quantitative liquidity requirements and communicating them to the institution, competent authorities should ensure that they are immediately notified by the institution if it does not meet the requirements, or does not expect to meet the requirements in the short term. Competent authorities should ensure that this notification is submitted without undue delay by the institution, accompanied by a plan drawn up by the institution for the timely restoration of compliance with the requirements. Competent authorities should assess the feasibility of the institution's restoration plan and take appropriate supervisory measures if the plan is not considered feasible. Where the plan is considered feasible, competent authorities should: determine any necessary interim supervisory measures based on the circumstances of the institution; monitor the implementation of the restoration plan; and closely monitor the institution's liquidity position, asking the institution to increase its reporting frequency if necessary.\n\n530. Notwithstanding the above, competent authorities may also set qualitative requirements in the form of restrictions/caps/limits on mismatches, concentrations, risk appetite, 193 quantitative restrictions on the issuance of secured loans, etc., in accordance with the criteria specified in Title 10 of the guidelines.\n\n531. Below are some examples of the different approaches for the structure of specific quantitative liquidity requirements: Example of specific requirements articulation As of 1 January 2021 and until otherwise directed, Bank X is required to: a. Approach 1 - ensure that its counterbalancing capacity is at all times equal to or higher than e.g. 125% of its liquidity net outflows as measured in the LCR. b. Approach 2 - ensure that its counterbalancing capacity results at all times in a survival period that is greater than or equal to 3 months, measured by the internal liquidity stress test / the maturity ladder / specific metrics developed by the supervisor. c. Approach 3: . ensure that its counterbalancing capacity is at all times equal to or higher than EUR X billion; or . ensure that its counterbalancing capacity is at all times equal to or higher than EUR X billion in excess of the minimum requirement under the LCR. d. Approach 4 - ensure that its available stable funding is at all times equal to or higher than e.g. 125% of its required stable funding as measured in the NSFR. e. Approach 5: . ensure that its available stable funding is at all times equal to or higher than EUR X billion; or . ensure that its available stable funding is at all times equal to or higher than EUR X billion in excess of the minimum requirement under the NSFR.",

    "paragraph_b_text": "526. To articulate the specific quantitative liquidity requirements appropriately, competent authorities should use one of the following approaches, unless another approach is considered more appropriate in specific circumstances: a. Approach 1 - require an LCR higher than the regulatory minimum, of such a size that shortcomings identified are sufficiently mitigated; b. Approach 2 - require a minimum survival period of such a length that identified shortcomings are sufficiently mitigated; the survival period can be set either directly, as a requirement, or indirectly, by setting a cap on the amount of outflows over the relevant time buckets considered; competent authorities may require different types of liquid assets (e.g. assets eligible for central banks), to cover risks not (adequately) covered by the LCR; 192 c. Approach 3 - require a minimum total amount of liquid assets or counterbalancing capacity, either as a minimum total amount or as a minimum amount in excess of the applicable regulatory minimum, of such a size that identified shortcomings are sufficiently mitigated; competent authorities may set requirements for the composition of liquid assets, including operational requirements (e.g. direct convertibility to cash, or deposit of the liquid assets at the central bank).\n\n527. To articulate the specific quantitative stable funding requirements appropriately, competent authorities should use one of the following approaches, unless another approach is considered more appropriate in specific circumstances: a. Approach 4 - require a NSFR higher than the regulatory minimum, of such a size that shortcomings identified are sufficiently mitigated; b. Approach 5 - require a minimum total amount of available stable funding, either as a minimum total amount or as a minimum amount in excess of the applicable regulatory minimum, of such a size that identified shortcomings are sufficiently mitigated.\n\n528. To ensure there is consistency, competent authorities should structure specific quantitative liquidity requirements in such a manner as to deliver broadly consistent prudential outcomes across institutions, bearing in mind that the types of requirements specified may differ between institutions because of their individual circumstances. In addition to the quantity, the structure should specify the expected composition and nature of the requirement. In all cases, it should specify the supervisory requirement and any applicable Directive 2013/36/EU requirements. Liquidity buffers and counterbalancing capacity held by the institution to meet supervisory requirements should be available for use by the institution during times of stress.\n\n529. When setting the specific quantitative liquidity requirements and communicating them to the institution, competent authorities should ensure that they are immediately notified by the institution if it does not meet the requirements, or does not expect to meet the requirements in the short term. Competent authorities should ensure that this notification is submitted without undue delay by the institution, accompanied by a plan drawn up by the institution for the timely restoration of compliance with the requirements. Competent authorities should assess the feasibility of the institution's restoration plan and take appropriate supervisory measures if the plan is not considered feasible. Where the plan is considered feasible, competent authorities should: determine any necessary interim supervisory measures based on the circumstances of the institution; monitor the implementation of the restoration plan; and closely monitor the institution's liquidity position, asking the institution to increase its reporting frequency if necessary.\n\n530. Notwithstanding the above, competent authorities may also set qualitative requirements in the form of restrictions/caps/limits on mismatches, concentrations, risk appetite, 193 quantitative restrictions on the issuance of secured loans, etc., in accordance with the criteria specified in Title 10 of the guidelines.\n\n531. Below are some examples of the different approaches for the structure of specific quantitative liquidity requirements: Example of specific requirements articulation As of 1 January 2021 and until otherwise directed, Bank X is required to: a. Approach 1 - ensure that its counterbalancing capacity is at all times equal to or higher than e.g. 125% of its liquidity net outflows as measured in the LCR. b. Approach 2 - ensure that its counterbalancing capacity results at all times in a survival period that is greater than or equal to 3 months, measured by the internal liquidity stress test / the maturity ladder / specific metrics developed by the supervisor. c. Approach 3: . ensure that its counterbalancing capacity is at all times equal to or higher than EUR X billion; or . ensure that its counterbalancing capacity is at all times equal to or higher than EUR X billion in excess of the minimum requirement under the LCR. d. Approach 4 - ensure that its available stable funding is at all times equal to or higher than e.g. 125% of its required stable funding as measured in the NSFR. e. Approach 5: . ensure that its available stable funding is at all times equal to or higher than EUR X billion; or . ensure that its available stable funding is at all times equal to or higher than EUR X billion in excess of the minimum requirement under the NSFR.",

    "paragraph_b_text": "526. To articulate the specific quantitative liquidity requirements appropriately, competent authorities should use one of the following approaches, unless another approach is considered more appropriate in specific circumstances: a. Approach 1 - require an LCR higher than the regulatory minimum, of such a size that shortcomings identified are sufficiently mitigated; b. Approach 2 - require a minimum survival period of such a length that identified shortcomings are sufficiently mitigated; the survival period can be set either directly, as a requirement, or indirectly, by setting a cap on the amount of outflows over the relevant time buckets considered; competent authorities may require different types of liquid assets (e.g. assets eligible for central banks), to cover risks not (adequately) covered by the LCR; 192 c. Approach 3 - require a minimum total amount of liquid assets or counterbalancing capacity, either as a minimum total amount or as a minimum amount in excess of the applicable regulatory minimum, of such a size that identified shortcomings are sufficiently mitigated; competent authorities may set requirements for the composition of liquid assets, including operational requirements (e.g. direct convertibility to cash, or deposit of the liquid assets at the central bank).\n\n527. To articulate the specific quantitative stable funding requirements appropriately, competent authorities should use one of the following approaches, unless another approach is considered more appropriate in specific circumstances: a. Approach 4 - require a NSFR higher than the regulatory minimum, of such a size that shortcomings identified are sufficiently mitigated; b. Approach 5 - require a minimum total amount of available stable funding, either as a minimum total amount or as a minimum amount in excess of the applicable regulatory minimum, of such a size that identified shortcomings are sufficiently mitigated.\n\n528. To ensure there is consistency, competent authorities should structure specific quantitative liquidity requirements in such a manner as to deliver broadly consistent prudential outcomes across institutions, bearing in mind that the types of requirements specified may differ between institutions because of their individual circumstances. In addition to the quantity, the structure should specify the expected composition and nature of the requirement. In all cases, it should specify the supervisory requirement and any applicable Directive 2013/36/EU requirements. Liquidity buffers and counterbalancing capacity held by the institution to meet supervisory requirements should be available for use by the institution during times of stress.\n\n529. When setting the specific quantitative liquidity requirements and communicating them to the institution, competent authorities should ensure that they are immediately notified by the institution if it does not meet the requirements, or does not expect to meet the requirements in the short term. Competent authorities should ensure that this notification is submitted without undue delay by the institution, accompanied by a plan drawn up by the institution for the timely restoration of compliance with the requirements. Competent authorities should assess the feasibility of the institution's restoration plan and take appropriate supervisory measures if the plan is not considered feasible. Where the plan is considered feasible, competent authorities should: determine any necessary interim supervisory measures based on the circumstances of the institution; monitor the implementation of the restoration plan; and closely monitor the institution's liquidity position, asking the institution to increase its reporting frequency if necessary.\n\n530. Notwithstanding the above, competent authorities may also set qualitative requirements in the form of restrictions/caps/limits on mismatches, concentrations, risk appetite, 193 quantitative restrictions on the issuance of secured loans, etc., in accordance with the criteria specified in Title 10 of the guidelines.\n\n531. Below are some examples of the different approaches for the structure of specific quantitative liquidity requirements: Example of specific requirements articulation As of 1 January 2021 and until otherwise directed, Bank X is required to: a. Approach 1 - ensure that its counterbalancing capacity is at all times equal to or higher than e.g. 125% of its liquidity net outflows as measured in the LCR. b. Approach 2 - ensure that its counterbalancing capacity results at all times in a survival period that is greater than or equal to 3 months, measured by the internal liquidity stress test / the maturity ladder / specific metrics developed by the supervisor. c. Approach 3: . ensure that its counterbalancing capacity is at all times equal to or higher than EUR X billion; or . ensure that its counterbalancing capacity is at all times equal to or higher than EUR X billion in excess of the minimum requirement under the LCR. d. Approach 4 - ensure that its available stable funding is at all times equal to or higher than e.g. 125% of its required stable funding as measured in the NSFR. e. Approach 5: . ensure that its available stable funding is at all times equal to or higher than EUR X billion; or . ensure that its available stable funding is at all times equal to or higher than EUR X billion in excess of the minimum requirement under the NSFR.",

Approach 3 - require a minimum total amount of liquid assets or counterbalancing capacity, either as a minimum total amount or as a minimum amount in excess of the applicable regulatory minimum, of such a size that identified shortcomings are sufficiently mitigated; competent authorities may set requirements for the composition of liquid assets, including operational requirements (e.g. direct convertibility to cash, or deposit of the liquid assets at the central bank).\n\n527.

Approach 5 - require a minimum total amount of available stable funding, either as a minimum total amount or as a minimum amount in excess of the applicable regulatory minimum, of such a size that identified shortcomings are sufficiently mitigated.\n\n528. To ensure there is consistency, competent authorities should structure specific quantitative liquidity requirements in such a manner as to deliver broadly consistent prudential outcomes across institutions, bearing in mind that the types of requirements specified may differ between institutions because of their individual circumstances. In addition to the quantity, the structure should specify the expected composition and nature of the requirement.

To articulate the specific quantitative liquidity requirements appropriately, competent authorities should use one of the following approaches, unless another approach is considered more appropriate in specific circumstances: a. Approach 1 - require an LCR higher than the regulatory minimum, of such a size that shortcomings identified are sufficiently mitigated; b. Approach 2 - require a minimum survival period of such a length that identified shortcomings are sufficiently mitigated; the survival period can be set either directly, as a requirement, or indirectly, by setting a cap on the amount of outflows over the relevant time buckets considered; competent authorities may require different types of liquid assets (e.g. assets eligible for central banks), to cover risks not (adequately) covered by the LCR; 192 c. Approach 3 - require a minimum total amount of liquid assets or counterbalancing capacity, either as a minimum total amount or as a minimum amount in excess of the applicable regulatory minimum, of such a size that identified shortcomings are sufficiently mitigated; competent authorities may set requirements for the composition of liquid assets, including operational requirements (e.g. direct convertibility to cash, or deposit of the liquid assets at the central bank).\n\n527. To articulate the specific quantitative stable funding requirements appropriately, competent authorities should use one of the following approaches, unless another approach is considered more appropriate in specific circumstances: a. Approach 4 - require a NSFR higher than the regulatory minimum, of such a size that shortcomings identified are sufficiently mitigated; b. Approach 5 - require a minimum total amount of available stable funding, either as a minimum total amount or as a minimum amount in excess of the applicable regulatory minimum, of such a size that identified shortcomings are sufficiently mitigated.\n\n528. To ensure there is consistency, competent authorities should structure specific quantitative liquidity requirements in such a manner as to deliver broadly consistent prudential outcomes across institutions, bearing in mind that the types of requirements specified may differ between institutions because of their individual circumstances. In addition to the quantity, the structure should specify the expected composition and nature of the requirement. In all cases, it should specify the supervisory requirement and any applicable Directive 2013/36/EU requirements. Liquidity buffers and counterbalancing capacity held by the institution to meet supervisory requirements should be available for use by the institution during times of stress.\n\n529. When setting the specific quantitative liquidity requirements and communicating them to the institution, competent authorities should ensure that they are immediately notified by the institution if it does not meet the requirements, or does not expect to meet the requirements in the short term. Competent authorities should ensure that this notification is submitted without undue delay by the institution, accompanied by a plan drawn up by the institution for the timely restoration of compliance with the requirements. Competent authorities should assess the feasibility of the institution's restoration plan and take appropriate supervisory measures if the plan is not considered feasible. Where the plan is considered feasible, competent authorities should: determine any necessary interim supervisory measures based on the circumstances of the institution; monitor the implementation of the restoration plan; and closely monitor the institution's liquidity position, asking the institution to increase its reporting frequency if necessary.\n\n530. Notwithstanding the above, competent authorities may also set qualitative requirements in the form of restrictions/caps/limits on mismatches, concentrations, risk appetite, 193 quantitative restrictions on the issuance of secured loans, etc., in accordance with the criteria specified in Title 10 of the guidelines.\n\n531. Below are some examples of the different approaches for the structure of specific quantitative liquidity requirements: Example of specific requirements articulation As of 1 January 2021 and until otherwise directed, Bank X is required to: a. Approach 1 - ensure that its counterbalancing capacity is at all times equal to or higher than e.g. 125% of its liquidity net outflows as measured in the LCR. b. Approach 2 - ensure that its counterbalancing capacity results at all times in a survival period that is greater than or equal to 3 months, measured by the internal liquidity stress test / the maturity ladder / specific metrics developed by the supervisor. c. Approach 3: . ensure that its counterbalancing capacity is at all times equal to or higher than EUR X billion; or . ensure that its counterbalancing capacity is at all times equal to or higher than EUR X billion in excess of the minimum requirement under the LCR. d.

    "paragraph_a_text": "526. To articulate the specific quantitative liquidity requirements appropriately, competent authorities should use one of the following approaches, unless another approach is considered more appropriate in specific circumstances: a. Approach 1 - require an LCR higher than the regulatory minimum, of such a size that shortcomings identified are sufficiently mitigated; b. Approach 2 - require a minimum survival period of such a length that identified shortcomings are sufficiently mitigated; the survival period can be set either directly, as a requirement, or indirectly, by setting a cap on the amount of outflows over the relevant time buckets considered; competent authorities may require different types of liquid assets (e.g. assets eligible for central banks), to cover risks not (adequately) covered by the LCR; 192 c. Approach 3 - require a minimum total amount of liquid assets or counterbalancing capacity, either as a minimum total amount or as a minimum amount in excess of the applicable regulatory minimum, of such a size that identified shortcomings are sufficiently mitigated; competent authorities may set requirements for the composition of liquid assets, including operational requirements (e.g. direct convertibility to cash, or deposit of the liquid assets at the central bank).\n\n527. To articulate the specific quantitative stable funding requirements appropriately, competent authorities should use one of the following approaches, unless another approach is considered more appropriate in specific circumstances: a. Approach 4 - require a NSFR higher than the regulatory minimum, of such a size that shortcomings identified are sufficiently mitigated; b. Approach 5 - require a minimum total amount of available stable funding, either as a minimum total amount or as a minimum amount in excess of the applicable regulatory minimum, of such a size that identified shortcomings are sufficiently mitigated.\n\n528. To ensure there is consistency, competent authorities should structure specific quantitative liquidity requirements in such a manner as to deliver broadly consistent prudential outcomes across institutions, bearing in mind that the types of requirements specified may differ between institutions because of their individual circumstances. In addition to the quantity, the structure should specify the expected composition and nature of the requirement. In all cases, it should specify the supervisory requirement and any applicable Directive 2013/36/EU requirements. Liquidity buffers and counterbalancing capacity held by the institution to meet supervisory requirements should be available for use by the institution during times of stress.\n\n529. When setting the specific quantitative liquidity requirements and communicating them to the institution, competent authorities should ensure that they are immediately notified by the institution if it does not meet the requirements, or does not expect to meet the requirements in the short term. Competent authorities should ensure that this notification is submitted without undue delay by the institution, accompanied by a plan drawn up by the institution for the timely restoration of compliance with the requirements. Competent authorities should assess the feasibility of the institution's restoration plan and take appropriate supervisory measures if the plan is not considered feasible. Where the plan is considered feasible, competent authorities should: determine any necessary interim supervisory measures based on the circumstances of the institution; monitor the implementation of the restoration plan; and closely monitor the institution's liquidity position, asking the institution to increase its reporting frequency if necessary.\n\n530. Notwithstanding the above, competent authorities may also set qualitative requirements in the form of restrictions/caps/limits on mismatches, concentrations, risk appetite, 193 quantitative restrictions on the issuance of secured loans, etc., in accordance with the criteria specified in Title 10 of the guidelines.\n\n531.

Institutions should take into account that liquidity or funding risks encompass: a) short- to medium-term liquidity risks; and b) funding risks.\n\n151. Institutions should analyse and measure themselves against risk factors relating to both asset- and liability-related items, as well as to off-balance-sheet commitments as defined in the EBA Guidelines on the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP).\n\n152. Institutions' analysis of risk factors should take into account, but should not be limited to: 41 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INSTITUTIONS' STRESS TESTING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY a) the impact of macroeconomic conditions, e.g. the impact of interest rate shocks on contingent cash flows; b) the currency of assets and liabilities including off-balance-sheet items, to reflect convertibility risk and possible disruptions in the access to foreign exchange markets; c) the location of liquidity needs and available funds, intragroup liquidity transactions and the risk of constraints for the transfer of funds between jurisdictions or group entities; d) actions that the institution may take to preserve its reputation or franchise (e.g. the early repayment of callable liabilities); e) the internalisation of risks related to specific activities, as in the case of prime brokerage where symmetry, to a certain extent, might be required between the lending side and the borrowing side of securities, i.e. customer long positions are funded using the proceeds from customer short trades. Such symmetry is subject to counterparties' behaviour and is therefore sensitive to reputational risk. In the event of such risk, it may trigger the unwinding of trades that would unexpectedly leave the institution with securities on its balance sheet, along with the need to fund them; f) the vulnerabilities within the funding term structure due to external, internal or contractual events; g) realistic run-off rates under normal conditions that accelerate in stressed times; h) concentration in funding; and i) estimates of future balance-sheet growth.\n\n153. 3. Institutions should subject these risk factors to sensitivity analyses which in turn should provide the appropriate quantitative background information for the design of scenarios.\n\n154. Institutions should apply the following three types of stress scenarios: an idiosyncratic scenario, a market-wide scenario and a combination of the two. As idiosyncratic stress scenario should assume institution-specific events (e.g. a rating downgrade, the default of the largest funding counterparty, a loss of market access, a loss of currency convertibility, the default of the counterparty providing the largest inflows), whereas a market-wide stress scenario should assume an impact on a group of institutions or the financial sector as a whole (e.g. a deterioration in funding market conditions or the macroeconomic environment, or rating downgrades of countries in which the institution operates).\n\n155. Institutions should design different time horizons in their stress testing: the time horizons should range from overnight up to at least 12 months; there should also be separate stress tests relating to intraday liquidity risks. The time horizon should display, for example, a short acute phase of stress (up to 30 days in order to cover such periods without having to change the business model) followed by a longer period of less acute but more prolonged stress (between 3 and 12 months). 42 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INSTITUTIONS' STRESS TESTING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY\n\n156. Institutions should combine the stress of the short- to medium-term liquidity risk with a stress of funding risk, considering a time horizon of at least 12 months.\n\n157. Institutions should design a set of adverse behavioural assumptions for customers including depositors, other providers of funds and counterparties for each different scenario and time horizon.\n\n158. .In the design of scenarios, institutions should consider the impact of stress events for other risk types, e.g. credit risk losses and reputational risk events, on their liquidity position, and the possibility of an impact of fire sales from other institutions (e.g. spillovers) or from their own liquidity buffer on the market-to-market value of other assets they hold.\n\n159. The main methodology used for calculating the magnitude of the impact should be the net cash flow profile. For each scenario, at each stress level, the institution identifies cash inflows and outflows that are projected for each future time period and the resulting net cash flows. Institutions should consider the lowest cumulative point of net cash flows within the time period assessed in each given scenario.\n\n160. Institutions should extend the analysis, if appropriate, to other metrics, such as: a) liquidity ratios and other metrics used in the framework, which should include, but may not be limited to, supervisory liquidity ratios and metrics, in particular the liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio; b) their available liquidity buffer, over and above the ratios referred to above, and other counterbalancing measures, i.e. their counterbalancing capacity, for each stress scenario; the stress testing of this metric should be accompanied by an assessment of the impact on the proportion and nature of encumbered assets; c) the survival horizon of the institution as derived from its counterbalancing capacity, i.e. the institution's ability to hold, or have access to, excess liquidity over short-term, medium- term and long-term time horizons in response to stress scenarios as defined in the EBA Guidelines on common procedures and methodologies for SREP, and stressed cash flows, taken jointly, before and after the impact of counterbalancing measures; d) solvency and profitability.\n\n61. When applying the different stress scenarios, institutions should assess and highlight counterbalancing effects provided by central banks (monetary policy) and adopt a conservative approach.\n\n162. Liquidity stress test metrics should include, if appropriate and in particular for at least all material currencies, a granularity per currency to allow the analysis of currency-specific assumptions in scenarios (e.g. volatility in exchange rates or currency mismatches).\n\n163. Institutions should, where appropriate, integrate liquidity stress test in their institution- wide stress tests, and take into account differences in the time periods covered in liquidity 43 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INSTITUTIONS' STRESS TESTING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY stress tests from those covered in institution-wide solvency stress tests. At a minimum, institutions should assess the impact of increasing funding costs on P&L. Institutions should take into account that linking funding costs to solvency position may influence the quality of the liquidity stress test, namely a too slow deterioration in liquidity.",

Institutions' analysis of risk factors should take into account, but should not be limited to: 41 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INSTITUTIONS' STRESS TESTING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY a) the impact of macroeconomic conditions, e.g. the impact of interest rate shocks on contingent cash flows; b) the currency of assets and liabilities including off-balance-sheet items, to reflect convertibility risk and possible disruptions in the access to foreign exchange markets; c) the location of liquidity needs and available funds, intragroup liquidity transactions and the risk of constraints for the transfer of funds between jurisdictions or group entities; d) actions that the institution may take to preserve its reputation or franchise (e.g. the early repayment of callable liabilities); e) the internalisation of risks related to specific activities, as in the case of prime brokerage where symmetry, to a certain extent, might be required between the lending side and the borrowing side of securities, i.e. customer long positions are funded using the proceeds from customer short trades. Such symmetry is subject to counterparties' behaviour and is therefore sensitive to reputational risk. In the event of such risk, it may trigger the unwinding of trades that would unexpectedly leave the institution with securities on its balance sheet, along with the need to fund them; f) the vulnerabilities within the funding term structure due to external, internal or contractual events; g) realistic run-off rates under normal conditions that accelerate in stressed times; h) concentration in funding; and i) estimates of future balance-sheet growth.\n\n153. 3. Institutions should subject these risk factors to sensitivity analyses which in turn should provide the appropriate quantitative background information for the design of scenarios.\n\n154. Institutions should apply the following three types of stress scenarios: an idiosyncratic scenario, a market-wide scenario and a combination of the two. As idiosyncratic stress scenario should assume institution-specific events (e.g. a rating downgrade, the default of the largest funding counterparty, a loss of market access, a loss of currency convertibility, the default of the counterparty providing the largest inflows), whereas a market-wide stress scenario should assume an impact on a group of institutions or the financial sector as a whole (e.g. a deterioration in funding market conditions or the macroeconomic environment, or rating downgrades of countries in which the institution operates).\n\n155. Institutions should design different time horizons in their stress testing: the time horizons should range from overnight up to at least 12 months; there should also be separate stress tests relating to intraday liquidity risks. The time horizon should display, for example, a short acute phase of stress (up to 30 days in order to cover such periods without having to change the business model) followed by a longer period of less acute but more prolonged stress (between 3 and 12 months). 42 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INSTITUTIONS' STRESS TESTING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY\n\n156. Institutions should combine the stress of the short- to medium-term liquidity risk with a stress of funding risk, considering a time horizon of at least 12 months.\n\n157. Institutions should design a set of adverse behavioural assumptions for customers including depositors, other providers of funds and counterparties for each different scenario and time horizon.\n\n158. .In the design of scenarios, institutions should consider the impact of stress events for other risk types, e.g. credit risk losses and reputational risk events, on their liquidity position, and the possibility of an impact of fire sales from other institutions (e.g. spillovers) or from their own liquidity buffer on the market-to-market value of other assets they hold.\n\n159. The main methodology used for calculating the magnitude of the impact should be the net cash flow profile. For each scenario, at each stress level, the institution identifies cash inflows and outflows that are projected for each future time period and the resulting net cash flows. Institutions should consider the lowest cumulative point of net cash flows within the time period assessed in each given scenario.\n\n160. Institutions should extend the analysis, if appropriate, to other metrics, such as: a) liquidity ratios and other metrics used in the framework, which should include, but may not be limited to, supervisory liquidity ratios and metrics, in particular the liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio; b) their available liquidity buffer, over and above the ratios referred to above, and other counterbalancing measures, i.e. their counterbalancing capacity, for each stress scenario; the stress testing of this metric should be accompanied by an assessment of the impact on the proportion and nature of encumbered assets; c) the survival horizon of the institution as derived from its counterbalancing capacity, i.e. the institution's ability to hold, or have access to, excess liquidity over short-term, medium- term and long-term time horizons in response to stress scenarios as defined in the EBA Guidelines on common procedures and methodologies for SREP, and stressed cash flows, taken jointly, before and after the impact of counterbalancing measures; d) solvency and profitability.\n\n61. When applying the different stress scenarios, institutions should assess and highlight counterbalancing effects provided by central banks (monetary policy) and adopt a conservative approach.\n\n162. Liquidity stress test metrics should include, if appropriate and in particular for at least all material currencies, a granularity per currency to allow the analysis of currency-specific assumptions in scenarios (e.g. volatility in exchange rates or currency mismatches).\n\n163. Institutions should, where appropriate, integrate liquidity stress test in their institution- wide stress tests, and take into account differences in the time periods covered in liquidity 43 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INSTITUTIONS' STRESS TESTING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY stress tests from those covered in institution-wide solvency stress tests.

Institutions' analysis of risk factors should take into account, but should not be limited to: 41 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INSTITUTIONS' STRESS TESTING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY a) the impact of macroeconomic conditions, e.g. the impact of interest rate shocks on contingent cash flows; b) the currency of assets and liabilities including off-balance-sheet items, to reflect convertibility risk and possible disruptions in the access to foreign exchange markets; c) the location of liquidity needs and available funds, intragroup liquidity transactions and the risk of constraints for the transfer of funds between jurisdictions or group entities; d) actions that the institution may take to preserve its reputation or franchise (e.g. the early repayment of callable liabilities); e) the internalisation of risks related to specific activities, as in the case of prime brokerage where symmetry, to a certain extent, might be required between the lending side and the borrowing side of securities, i.e. customer long positions are funded using the proceeds from customer short trades. Such symmetry is subject to counterparties' behaviour and is therefore sensitive to reputational risk. In the event of such risk, it may trigger the unwinding of trades that would unexpectedly leave the institution with securities on its balance sheet, along with the need to fund them; f) the vulnerabilities within the funding term structure due to external, internal or contractual events; g) realistic run-off rates under normal conditions that accelerate in stressed times; h) concentration in funding; and i) estimates of future balance-sheet growth.\n\n153. 3. Institutions should subject these risk factors to sensitivity analyses which in turn should provide the appropriate quantitative background information for the design of scenarios.\n\n154. Institutions should apply the following three types of stress scenarios: an idiosyncratic scenario, a market-wide scenario and a combination of the two. As idiosyncratic stress scenario should assume institution-specific events (e.g. a rating downgrade, the default of the largest funding counterparty, a loss of market access, a loss of currency convertibility, the default of the counterparty providing the largest inflows), whereas a market-wide stress scenario should assume an impact on a group of institutions or the financial sector as a whole (e.g. a deterioration in funding market conditions or the macroeconomic environment, or rating downgrades of countries in which the institution operates).\n\n155. Institutions should design different time horizons in their stress testing: the time horizons should range from overnight up to at least 12 months; there should also be separate stress tests relating to intraday liquidity risks. The time horizon should display, for example, a short acute phase of stress (up to 30 days in order to cover such periods without having to change the business model) followed by a longer period of less acute but more prolonged stress (between 3 and 12 months). 42 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INSTITUTIONS' STRESS TESTING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY\n\n156. Institutions should combine the stress of the short- to medium-term liquidity risk with a stress of funding risk, considering a time horizon of at least 12 months.\n\n157. Institutions should design a set of adverse behavioural assumptions for customers including depositors, other providers of funds and counterparties for each different scenario and time horizon.\n\n158. .In the design of scenarios, institutions should consider the impact of stress events for other risk types, e.g. credit risk losses and reputational risk events, on their liquidity position, and the possibility of an impact of fire sales from other institutions (e.g. spillovers) or from their own liquidity buffer on the market-to-market value of other assets they hold.\n\n159. The main methodology used for calculating the magnitude of the impact should be the net cash flow profile. For each scenario, at each stress level, the institution identifies cash inflows and outflows that are projected for each future time period and the resulting net cash flows. Institutions should consider the lowest cumulative point of net cash flows within the time period assessed in each given scenario.\n\n160. Institutions should extend the analysis, if appropriate, to other metrics, such as: a) liquidity ratios and other metrics used in the framework, which should include, but may not be limited to, supervisory liquidity ratios and metrics, in particular the liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio; b) their available liquidity buffer, over and above the ratios referred to above, and other counterbalancing measures, i.e. their counterbalancing capacity, for each stress scenario; the stress testing of this metric should be accompanied by an assessment of the impact on the proportion and nature of encumbered assets; c) the survival horizon of the institution as derived from its counterbalancing capacity, i.e. the institution's ability to hold, or have access to, excess liquidity over short-term, medium- term and long-term time horizons in response to stress scenarios as defined in the EBA Guidelines on common procedures and methodologies for SREP, and stressed cash flows, taken jointly, before and after the impact of counterbalancing measures; d) solvency and profitability.\n\n61. When applying the different stress scenarios, institutions should assess and highlight counterbalancing effects provided by central banks (monetary policy) and adopt a conservative approach.\n\n162. Liquidity stress test metrics should include, if appropriate and in particular for at least all material currencies, a granularity per currency to allow the analysis of currency-specific assumptions in scenarios (e.g. volatility in exchange rates or currency mismatches).\n\n163. Institutions should, where appropriate, integrate liquidity stress test in their institution- wide stress tests, and take into account differences in the time periods covered in liquidity 43 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INSTITUTIONS' STRESS TESTING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY stress tests from those covered in institution-wide solvency stress tests. At a minimum, institutions should assess the impact of increasing funding costs on P&L. Institutions should take into account that linking funding costs to solvency position may influence the quality of the liquidity stress test, namely a too slow deterioration in liquidity.",
