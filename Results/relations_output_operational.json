Competent authorities should assess the materiality of operational risk arising from outsourced services and activities, and whether these could affect the institution's ability to process transactions and/or provide services, or cause legal liabilities for damage to third parties (e.g. customers and other stakeholders).\n\n74. When assessing operational risk, competent authorities should assess ICT risk, as ICT performance and security are considered paramount for an institution to conduct its business. Thus, competent authorities should assess potential impact of ICT risks on the critical activities of an institution and consider the potential financial, reputational, regulatory and strategic impact on the institution as well as the potential for business disruption.\n\n275. Competent authorities should assess reputational risk jointly with operational risk because of the strong links between the two (e.g. most operational risk events have a strong impact in terms of reputation). However, the outcome of reputational risk assessment should not be reflected in the scoring of operational risk but, where relevant, should be considered as part of the BMA and/or the liquidity risk assessment, since the main effects it can have are reductions 109 in earnings and loss of confidence in or disaffection with the institution by investors, depositors or interbank-market participants.\n\n276. In assessing operational risk, competent authorities should use, to the extent possible, the event-type classification for the advanced measurement approaches provided in Article 324 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and specified in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2018/95934to gain a clearer view of the spectrum of operational risks and to achieve a level of consistency in analysing these risks across institutions, irrespective of the approach adopted to determine own funds requirements for operational risk. When assessing operational risk, competent authorities should also consider conduct risk, model risk and ICT risk.",

    "paragraph_b_text": "310. Competent authorities should assess the framework and arrangements that the institution has specifically to manage and control operational risk as an individual risk category. This assessment should take into account the outcome of the analysis of the overall risk management and internal-control framework addressed in Title 5, as this will influence the institution's operational risk exposures. Regarding ML/TF risk, the competent authority should take into account the assessment provided by the AML/CFT supervisor.\n\n311. Competent authorities should approach this review having regard to the key operational risk drivers (i.e. people, processes, external factors, systems), which can also act as mitigating factors, and should consider: a. the operational risk management strategy and appetite; b. the organisational framework; c. policies and procedures; d. operational risk identification, measurement, monitoring and reporting; e. business resilience and continuity plans; and f. the internal control framework as it applies to the management of operational risk. Operational risk management strategy and appetite\n\n312. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has defined and formalised a sound operational risk management strategy and appetite level, approved by the management body. For this assessment, competent authorities should take into account whether: 118 a. the management body clearly expresses the operational risk management strategy and appetite level, as well as the process for the review thereof (e.g. in the event of an overall risk strategy review, a loss trend and/or capital adequacy concerns, etc.); b. senior management properly implements and monitors the operational risk management strategy approved by the management body, ensuring that the institution's operational risk mitigation measures are consistent with the strategy established; c. these strategies are appropriate and efficient with respect to the nature and materiality of the operational risk profile and whether the institution monitors their effectiveness over time and their consistency with the operational risk appetite level; d. the institution's operational risk management strategy covers all the activities, processes and systems of the institution - including on a forward-looking basis through the strategic plan - where operational risk is or may be significant; and e. the institution has an appropriate framework in place to ensure that the operational risk management strategy is effectively communicated to relevant staff.\n\n313. To assess the credibility of such strategies, competent authorities should also assess whether the institution has allocated sufficient resources to their implementation, and whether relevant decisions taken are irrespective of minimum own funds requirements benefits that might accrue (in particular for institutions adopting the BIA or TSA approaches to determine minimum own funds requirements). Organisational framework for management and oversight of operational risk\n\n314. Competent authorities should assess the soundness and effectiveness of the organisational framework with respect to the management of operational risk. In this regard, the competent authority should determine whether: a. there are clear lines of responsibility for the identification, analysis, assessment, mitigation, monitoring and reporting of operational risk; b. the operational risk control and monitoring systems are subject to independent review and there is a clear separation between risk-takers and risk managers, between these and the risk control and oversight risk functions; c. the risk management, measurement, and control functions cover operational risk across the entire institution (including branches) in an integrated manner, 119 irrespective of the measurement approach adopted to determine minimum own funds, and also cover outsourced business functions and other activities; and d. the operational risk management framework is structured with sufficient and qualitatively appropriate human and technical resources. Policies and procedures\n\n315. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has appropriate policies and procedures for the management of operational risk, including residual risk after mitigation techniques have been applied. For this assessment, competent authorities should take into account whether: a. the management body approves the policies for managing operational risk and reviews them regularly, in line with the operational risk management strategies; b. senior management is responsible for developing and implementing the policies and procedures for managing operational risk; c. operational risk management policies and procedures are clearly formalised and communicated throughout the institution and are applied consistently across the institution, or at least those processes and businesses most exposed to operational risk; d. policies and procedures cover all the elements of operational risk management, measurement and control including, where relevant, loss data collection, quantification methodologies, mitigation techniques (e.g. insurance policies), causal analysis techniques in respect of operational risk events, limits and the handling of exceptions to those limits; e. the institution has implemented an approval process for new products, processes and systems that requires assessment and mitigation of potential operational risks raised by the implementation and the development of the related new products, processes and systems; f. such policies are adequate for the nature and complexity of the institution's activities, and enable a clear understanding of the operational risk inherent to the different products and activities under the scope of the institution; g. the institution promotes an operational risk management culture throughout the organisation, by means of training and by setting targets for operational loss reduction. Risk identification, measurement, monitoring and reporting 120\n\n316. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has an appropriate framework for identifying, assessing, measuring and monitoring operational risk, in line with the institution's size and complexity, and whether the framework is compliant, as a minimum, with the relevant minimum own funds requirements under the relevant EU and national implementing legislation. Competent authorities should take into account whether: a. the institution has implemented effective processes and procedures for comprehensive identification and assessment of operational risk exposure (e.g. Risk and Control Self-Assessments (RCSA)) and for the detection and accurate categorisation of relevant events (i.e. loss data collection, 'near misses' with no loss impact or even events that generate unexpected gains), including boundary cases with other risks (e.g. credit loss caused or augmented by an operational risk event); in this regard, competent authorities should also determine the ability of the institution to identify the key drivers of relevant operational losses and use this information for operational risk management purposes; b. for the purposes of Article 101 of Directive 2013/36/EU, if the institution is authorised to use an internal model to determine minimum own funds requirements for operational risk, the institution continues to fulfil the minimum requirements specified in the relevant EU and national implementing legislation and whether such an internal model involves any material risk underestimation; c. the institution has appropriate information systems and methodologies to quantify or assess the operational risk, which comply, as a minimum, with requirements for determining relevant minimum own funds as specified in the relevant EU and national implementing legislation (e.g. for TSA, mapping of relevant profit and loss items to the eight regulatory business lines; for the AMA, the length of time series, treatment of insurance, correlation, etc.); d. the institution has implemented adequate stress testing and scenario analysis, as appropriate, to understand the impact of adverse operational events on its profitability and own funds, also taking into due consideration the potential failure of internal controls and mitigation techniques; where relevant, competent authorities should consider the consistency of these analyses with the RCSA and with the outcome of peer analysis; e. the institution's management body and senior management understand the assumptions underlying the measurement system and whether they are aware of the degree of relevant model risk; f. the institution has defined and implemented continuous and effective monitoring of operational risk exposures throughout the institution, including outsourced activities and new products and systems, amongst others, by means of specific 121 forward-looking indicators (key risk indicators and key control indicators) and relevant triggers to provide effective early warning alerts; g. the institution has defined adequate actions to respond to residual risks to keep them within the limits defined in the risk appetite; h. the institution has implemented regular reporting on operational risk exposure, including stress testing outcomes, to the management body, senior management and the managers of relevant businesses and processes as appropriate.\n\n317. Competent authorities should assess the institution's ICT risk management framework in accordance with the EBA Guidelines on ICT Risk Assessment under the SREP and having regard to the EBA Guidelines on ICT and security risk management. Business resilience and continuity plans\n\n318. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has in place comprehensive and tested business resilience and continuity plans, covering at least critical and important functions, including those that are outsourced, to ensure that it is able to operate on an ongoing basis and limit losses in the event of severe business disruption. For outsourced activities, competent authorities should ensure that the service provider has a suitable business continuity plan in line with the EBA Guidelines on outsourcing arrangements.\n\n319. Competent authorities should determine whether the institution has established business continuity plans commensurate with the nature, size and complexity of its operations. Such plans should take into account different types of likely or plausible scenarios to which the institution may be vulnerable.\n\n320. Competent authorities should assess the quality and effectiveness of the institution's continuity management planning process. In doing so, competent authorities should evaluate the quality of the institution's adherence to recognised Business Continuity Management (BCM) processes. Accordingly, competent authorities should determine whether the institution's continuity management planning process includes: a. a Business Impact Analysis; b. appropriate recovery strategies incorporating internal and external dependencies and clearly defined recovery priorities; c. the drafting of comprehensive and flexible plans to deal with plausible scenarios; d. effective testing of the design and operational effectiveness of the plans; e. BCM awareness and training programmes; and f. communications and crisis-management documentation and training. 122 Internal control framework\n\n321. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has a strong control framework and sound safeguards to mitigate its operational risk, in line with its operational risk management appetite and strategy. Competent authorities should take into account whether: a. the scope covered by the institution's control functions includes all consolidated entities and geographical locations; b. there are internal controls and other practices (e.g. risk responses, such as conduct policies, risk transfer techniques, etc.) aimed at mitigating operational risk exposures or curtailing potential impacts, and keeping them within levels acceptable to the institution, in accordance with the parameters set by the management body and senior management and the institution's risk appetite level; and c. the institution has appropriate internal controls and practices to ensure that breaches of and exceptions to policies, procedures and limits are reported in a timely manner to the appropriate level of management for action, and to competent authorities as required.\n\n322. Competent authorities should also assess the functionality of the internal audit function. To this end, they should determine whether: a. the institution conducts internal audits of the operational risk management framework on a regular basis; b. the internal audit covers the main elements of operational risk management measurement and control across the institution; and c. such audits are effective in determining adherence to internal policies and any relevant external regulations and addressing any deviations from them.\n\n323. For institutions using the AMA to determine minimum own funds requirements for operational risk, competent authorities should also assess whether the internal approach- validation process is sound and effective in challenging model assumptions and identifying any potential shortcomings with respect to operational risk modelling, quantification and systems and other relevant minimum requirements specified in the relevant EU and national implementing legislation.\n\n324. Irrespective of the approach adopted by the institution to determine regulatory minimum own funds, when models are used for decision-making (e.g. credit lending, pricing, trading financial instruments, etc.), competent authorities should assess whether there is a sound internal validation process and/or model-review process to identify and mitigate model risk. 123 Management of reputational risk\n\n325. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has implemented adequate arrangements, strategies, processes and mechanisms to manage reputational risk. In particular, competent authorities should take into account whether: a. the institution has formalised policies and processes in place for the identification, management and monitoring of this risk, and whether these policies and processes are proportionate to its size and its relevance in the system; b. the institution addresses this risk in a precautionary manner, for example by setting limits or requiring approval for allocating capital to specific countries, sectors or persons and/or whether its contingency plans address the need to deal proactively with reputational issues in the event of a crisis; c. the institution conducts stress testing or scenario analysis to assess any secondary effects of reputational risk (e.g. liquidity, funding costs, access to correspondent banking service, etc.); d. the institution acts to protect its brand through prompt communication campaigns where specific events occur that might endanger its reputation; and e. the institution considers the potential impact of its strategy and business plans, and more generally of its behaviour, on its reputation.",

    "paragraph_b_text": "630. The supervisory stress testing programme set out by the competent authorities should ensure at least the following: a. When designing methodologies and assumptions for use in supervisory stress tests, competent authorities should decide on the design and features of the exercise that are most suitable for its intended purpose, i.e. that are linked to the supervisory (or other) objectives set by the competent authority. b. When conducting supervisory stress tests on a wider sample of institutions, competent authorities may consider adopting the design of supervisory stress tests for different categories of institutions as set out in Section 2.4, especially if the exercise is top-down. c. Competent authorities should consider the appropriate timelines for conducting supervisory stress tests, including the time horizon of the scenarios and the period over which the management actions proposed by institutions in the stress test exercise are analysed. The timelines for the exercise should also factor in the dialogue with the institution, where relevant for the intended purpose of the exercise and the extent to which the data supplied by the participating institution will remain relevant. d. Competent authorities should consider, where relevant for the intended purpose of the exercise, all known future regulatory changes affecting institutions within the scope and time horizon of the exercise.\n\n631. In the case of a scenario analysis stress test, competent authorities should decide whether to run a single scenario to be applied to all institutions included in the scope of the exercise, or to develop institution-specific scenarios for individual institutions (the latter should not be seen 225 as relieving institutions from the responsibility of designing own scenarios for the purposes of ICAAP and ILAAP stress testing), or a combination of the two. Competent authorities should consider the transferability of capital and liquidity resources in stressed conditions and any possible impediments, including legal and operational impediments, that may exist.\n\n632. Furthermore, the following aspects should be considered when developing the methodologies for supervisory stress tests: a. For the purposes of the assessment of capital adequacy, competent authorities should consider the impact of the stress test on the institution's P&L, balance sheet, risk exposure amount and leverage ratio, and analyse the impact of the stress test on the capital ratios of institutions covered by the exercise. b. For the purposes of bottom-up stress tests, competent authorities should consider the extent to which they prescribe the methodologies for modelling institutions' balance sheets and P&L. Indicatively, institutions' balance sheets may be taken as static, allowing competent authorities to assess current risks over time. Alternatively, they may be allowed to be dynamic, permitting, for example, a more forward-looking exploration of how institutions' business plans might evolve under the stress scenario or how credit volumes might evolve over time. For enhanced comparability, competent authorities may consider opting for the static balance sheet approach. Conversely, for enhanced feedback on institutions' intended or planned reactions vis-a-vis stresses and shocks, the dynamic balance sheet approach may be favoured. c. Competent authorities should consider how to take account of systemic feedback or second-round effects in the stress tests, where relevant, recognising the limitations of providing ex ante assumptions in the case of bottom-up stress tests. d. For the purposes of bottom-up supervisory stress tests, competent authorities should aim to assess the impact of such exercises consistently and fairly across the institutions covered by supervisory stress tests, respecting the level playing field. Competent authorities should also consider the extent to which stress test results reflect differences in modelling choices and judgements among institutions, rather than true differences in the risks to which they are exposed.\n\n633. Competent authorities should aim to assess model risk across stress testing exercises and have access to different types of comparative information. It is recommended to have, where appropriate, several perspectives/benchmarks. It is important to recognise that all models are imperfect and to clearly identify known and potential weaknesses. Understanding these limitations and weaknesses of individual institutions' stress testing models can inform the supervisory stress testing process and mitigate potential problems arising from model risk. 226 Annexes Annex 1. Operational risk, examples of the link between losses and risk drivers To illustrate how operational risk manifests itself, it is necessary to understand the relationship between the drivers of a specific risk event and the impact (i.e. outcome) of the risk event. Some examples are given in the following table56. Driver Risk event Impact types (outcomes) People Arson - a deliberate act committed by a person Fire - the event · Death/injury .

    "paragraph_b_text": "310. Competent authorities should assess the framework and arrangements that the institution has specifically to manage and control operational risk as an individual risk category. This assessment should take into account the outcome of the analysis of the overall risk management and internal-control framework addressed in Title 5, as this will influence the institution's operational risk exposures. Regarding ML/TF risk, the competent authority should take into account the assessment provided by the AML/CFT supervisor.\n\n311. Competent authorities should approach this review having regard to the key operational risk drivers (i.e. people, processes, external factors, systems), which can also act as mitigating factors, and should consider: a. the operational risk management strategy and appetite; b. the organisational framework; c. policies and procedures; d. operational risk identification, measurement, monitoring and reporting; e. business resilience and continuity plans; and f. the internal control framework as it applies to the management of operational risk. Operational risk management strategy and appetite\n\n312. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has defined and formalised a sound operational risk management strategy and appetite level, approved by the management body. For this assessment, competent authorities should take into account whether: 118 a. the management body clearly expresses the operational risk management strategy and appetite level, as well as the process for the review thereof (e.g. in the event of an overall risk strategy review, a loss trend and/or capital adequacy concerns, etc.); b. senior management properly implements and monitors the operational risk management strategy approved by the management body, ensuring that the institution's operational risk mitigation measures are consistent with the strategy established; c. these strategies are appropriate and efficient with respect to the nature and materiality of the operational risk profile and whether the institution monitors their effectiveness over time and their consistency with the operational risk appetite level; d. the institution's operational risk management strategy covers all the activities, processes and systems of the institution - including on a forward-looking basis through the strategic plan - where operational risk is or may be significant; and e. the institution has an appropriate framework in place to ensure that the operational risk management strategy is effectively communicated to relevant staff.\n\n313. To assess the credibility of such strategies, competent authorities should also assess whether the institution has allocated sufficient resources to their implementation, and whether relevant decisions taken are irrespective of minimum own funds requirements benefits that might accrue (in particular for institutions adopting the BIA or TSA approaches to determine minimum own funds requirements). Organisational framework for management and oversight of operational risk\n\n314. Competent authorities should assess the soundness and effectiveness of the organisational framework with respect to the management of operational risk. In this regard, the competent authority should determine whether: a. there are clear lines of responsibility for the identification, analysis, assessment, mitigation, monitoring and reporting of operational risk; b. the operational risk control and monitoring systems are subject to independent review and there is a clear separation between risk-takers and risk managers, between these and the risk control and oversight risk functions; c. the risk management, measurement, and control functions cover operational risk across the entire institution (including branches) in an integrated manner, 119 irrespective of the measurement approach adopted to determine minimum own funds, and also cover outsourced business functions and other activities; and d. the operational risk management framework is structured with sufficient and qualitatively appropriate human and technical resources. Policies and procedures\n\n315. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has appropriate policies and procedures for the management of operational risk, including residual risk after mitigation techniques have been applied. For this assessment, competent authorities should take into account whether: a. the management body approves the policies for managing operational risk and reviews them regularly, in line with the operational risk management strategies; b. senior management is responsible for developing and implementing the policies and procedures for managing operational risk; c. operational risk management policies and procedures are clearly formalised and communicated throughout the institution and are applied consistently across the institution, or at least those processes and businesses most exposed to operational risk; d. policies and procedures cover all the elements of operational risk management, measurement and control including, where relevant, loss data collection, quantification methodologies, mitigation techniques (e.g. insurance policies), causal analysis techniques in respect of operational risk events, limits and the handling of exceptions to those limits; e. the institution has implemented an approval process for new products, processes and systems that requires assessment and mitigation of potential operational risks raised by the implementation and the development of the related new products, processes and systems; f. such policies are adequate for the nature and complexity of the institution's activities, and enable a clear understanding of the operational risk inherent to the different products and activities under the scope of the institution; g. the institution promotes an operational risk management culture throughout the organisation, by means of training and by setting targets for operational loss reduction. Risk identification, measurement, monitoring and reporting 120\n\n316. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has an appropriate framework for identifying, assessing, measuring and monitoring operational risk, in line with the institution's size and complexity, and whether the framework is compliant, as a minimum, with the relevant minimum own funds requirements under the relevant EU and national implementing legislation. Competent authorities should take into account whether: a. the institution has implemented effective processes and procedures for comprehensive identification and assessment of operational risk exposure (e.g. Risk and Control Self-Assessments (RCSA)) and for the detection and accurate categorisation of relevant events (i.e. loss data collection, 'near misses' with no loss impact or even events that generate unexpected gains), including boundary cases with other risks (e.g. credit loss caused or augmented by an operational risk event); in this regard, competent authorities should also determine the ability of the institution to identify the key drivers of relevant operational losses and use this information for operational risk management purposes; b. for the purposes of Article 101 of Directive 2013/36/EU, if the institution is authorised to use an internal model to determine minimum own funds requirements for operational risk, the institution continues to fulfil the minimum requirements specified in the relevant EU and national implementing legislation and whether such an internal model involves any material risk underestimation; c. the institution has appropriate information systems and methodologies to quantify or assess the operational risk, which comply, as a minimum, with requirements for determining relevant minimum own funds as specified in the relevant EU and national implementing legislation (e.g. for TSA, mapping of relevant profit and loss items to the eight regulatory business lines; for the AMA, the length of time series, treatment of insurance, correlation, etc.); d. the institution has implemented adequate stress testing and scenario analysis, as appropriate, to understand the impact of adverse operational events on its profitability and own funds, also taking into due consideration the potential failure of internal controls and mitigation techniques; where relevant, competent authorities should consider the consistency of these analyses with the RCSA and with the outcome of peer analysis; e. the institution's management body and senior management understand the assumptions underlying the measurement system and whether they are aware of the degree of relevant model risk; f. the institution has defined and implemented continuous and effective monitoring of operational risk exposures throughout the institution, including outsourced activities and new products and systems, amongst others, by means of specific 121 forward-looking indicators (key risk indicators and key control indicators) and relevant triggers to provide effective early warning alerts; g. the institution has defined adequate actions to respond to residual risks to keep them within the limits defined in the risk appetite; h. the institution has implemented regular reporting on operational risk exposure, including stress testing outcomes, to the management body, senior management and the managers of relevant businesses and processes as appropriate.\n\n317. Competent authorities should assess the institution's ICT risk management framework in accordance with the EBA Guidelines on ICT Risk Assessment under the SREP and having regard to the EBA Guidelines on ICT and security risk management. Business resilience and continuity plans\n\n318. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has in place comprehensive and tested business resilience and continuity plans, covering at least critical and important functions, including those that are outsourced, to ensure that it is able to operate on an ongoing basis and limit losses in the event of severe business disruption. For outsourced activities, competent authorities should ensure that the service provider has a suitable business continuity plan in line with the EBA Guidelines on outsourcing arrangements.\n\n319. Competent authorities should determine whether the institution has established business continuity plans commensurate with the nature, size and complexity of its operations. Such plans should take into account different types of likely or plausible scenarios to which the institution may be vulnerable.\n\n320. Competent authorities should assess the quality and effectiveness of the institution's continuity management planning process. In doing so, competent authorities should evaluate the quality of the institution's adherence to recognised Business Continuity Management (BCM) processes. Accordingly, competent authorities should determine whether the institution's continuity management planning process includes: a. a Business Impact Analysis; b. appropriate recovery strategies incorporating internal and external dependencies and clearly defined recovery priorities; c. the drafting of comprehensive and flexible plans to deal with plausible scenarios; d. effective testing of the design and operational effectiveness of the plans; e. BCM awareness and training programmes; and f. communications and crisis-management documentation and training. 122 Internal control framework\n\n321. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has a strong control framework and sound safeguards to mitigate its operational risk, in line with its operational risk management appetite and strategy. Competent authorities should take into account whether: a. the scope covered by the institution's control functions includes all consolidated entities and geographical locations; b. there are internal controls and other practices (e.g. risk responses, such as conduct policies, risk transfer techniques, etc.) aimed at mitigating operational risk exposures or curtailing potential impacts, and keeping them within levels acceptable to the institution, in accordance with the parameters set by the management body and senior management and the institution's risk appetite level; and c. the institution has appropriate internal controls and practices to ensure that breaches of and exceptions to policies, procedures and limits are reported in a timely manner to the appropriate level of management for action, and to competent authorities as required.\n\n322. Competent authorities should also assess the functionality of the internal audit function. To this end, they should determine whether: a. the institution conducts internal audits of the operational risk management framework on a regular basis; b. the internal audit covers the main elements of operational risk management measurement and control across the institution; and c. such audits are effective in determining adherence to internal policies and any relevant external regulations and addressing any deviations from them.\n\n323. For institutions using the AMA to determine minimum own funds requirements for operational risk, competent authorities should also assess whether the internal approach- validation process is sound and effective in challenging model assumptions and identifying any potential shortcomings with respect to operational risk modelling, quantification and systems and other relevant minimum requirements specified in the relevant EU and national implementing legislation.\n\n324. Irrespective of the approach adopted by the institution to determine regulatory minimum own funds, when models are used for decision-making (e.g. credit lending, pricing, trading financial instruments, etc.), competent authorities should assess whether there is a sound internal validation process and/or model-review process to identify and mitigate model risk. 123 Management of reputational risk\n\n325. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has implemented adequate arrangements, strategies, processes and mechanisms to manage reputational risk. In particular, competent authorities should take into account whether: a. the institution has formalised policies and processes in place for the identification, management and monitoring of this risk, and whether these policies and processes are proportionate to its size and its relevance in the system; b. the institution addresses this risk in a precautionary manner, for example by setting limits or requiring approval for allocating capital to specific countries, sectors or persons and/or whether its contingency plans address the need to deal proactively with reputational issues in the event of a crisis; c. the institution conducts stress testing or scenario analysis to assess any secondary effects of reputational risk (e.g. liquidity, funding costs, access to correspondent banking service, etc.); d. the institution acts to protect its brand through prompt communication campaigns where specific events occur that might endanger its reputation; and e. the institution considers the potential impact of its strategy and business plans, and more generally of its behaviour, on its reputation.",

    "paragraph_b_text": "630. The supervisory stress testing programme set out by the competent authorities should ensure at least the following: a. When designing methodologies and assumptions for use in supervisory stress tests, competent authorities should decide on the design and features of the exercise that are most suitable for its intended purpose, i.e. that are linked to the supervisory (or other) objectives set by the competent authority. b. When conducting supervisory stress tests on a wider sample of institutions, competent authorities may consider adopting the design of supervisory stress tests for different categories of institutions as set out in Section 2.4, especially if the exercise is top-down. c. Competent authorities should consider the appropriate timelines for conducting supervisory stress tests, including the time horizon of the scenarios and the period over which the management actions proposed by institutions in the stress test exercise are analysed. The timelines for the exercise should also factor in the dialogue with the institution, where relevant for the intended purpose of the exercise and the extent to which the data supplied by the participating institution will remain relevant. d. Competent authorities should consider, where relevant for the intended purpose of the exercise, all known future regulatory changes affecting institutions within the scope and time horizon of the exercise.\n\n631. In the case of a scenario analysis stress test, competent authorities should decide whether to run a single scenario to be applied to all institutions included in the scope of the exercise, or to develop institution-specific scenarios for individual institutions (the latter should not be seen 225 as relieving institutions from the responsibility of designing own scenarios for the purposes of ICAAP and ILAAP stress testing), or a combination of the two. Competent authorities should consider the transferability of capital and liquidity resources in stressed conditions and any possible impediments, including legal and operational impediments, that may exist.\n\n632. Furthermore, the following aspects should be considered when developing the methodologies for supervisory stress tests: a. For the purposes of the assessment of capital adequacy, competent authorities should consider the impact of the stress test on the institution's P&L, balance sheet, risk exposure amount and leverage ratio, and analyse the impact of the stress test on the capital ratios of institutions covered by the exercise. b. For the purposes of bottom-up stress tests, competent authorities should consider the extent to which they prescribe the methodologies for modelling institutions' balance sheets and P&L. Indicatively, institutions' balance sheets may be taken as static, allowing competent authorities to assess current risks over time. Alternatively, they may be allowed to be dynamic, permitting, for example, a more forward-looking exploration of how institutions' business plans might evolve under the stress scenario or how credit volumes might evolve over time. For enhanced comparability, competent authorities may consider opting for the static balance sheet approach. Conversely, for enhanced feedback on institutions' intended or planned reactions vis-a-vis stresses and shocks, the dynamic balance sheet approach may be favoured. c. Competent authorities should consider how to take account of systemic feedback or second-round effects in the stress tests, where relevant, recognising the limitations of providing ex ante assumptions in the case of bottom-up stress tests. d. For the purposes of bottom-up supervisory stress tests, competent authorities should aim to assess the impact of such exercises consistently and fairly across the institutions covered by supervisory stress tests, respecting the level playing field. Competent authorities should also consider the extent to which stress test results reflect differences in modelling choices and judgements among institutions, rather than true differences in the risks to which they are exposed.\n\n633. Competent authorities should aim to assess model risk across stress testing exercises and have access to different types of comparative information. It is recommended to have, where appropriate, several perspectives/benchmarks. It is important to recognise that all models are imperfect and to clearly identify known and potential weaknesses. Understanding these limitations and weaknesses of individual institutions' stress testing models can inform the supervisory stress testing process and mitigate potential problems arising from model risk. 226 Annexes Annex 1. Operational risk, examples of the link between losses and risk drivers To illustrate how operational risk manifests itself, it is necessary to understand the relationship between the drivers of a specific risk event and the impact (i.e. outcome) of the risk event. Some examples are given in the following table56. Driver Risk event Impact types (outcomes) People Arson - a deliberate act committed by a person Fire - the event · Death/injury .

Where an institution creates many legal entities within its group, their number and, in particular, the interconnections and transactions between them should not pose challenges for the design of its internal governance, and for the effective management and oversight of the risks of the group as a whole . The management body should ensure that the structure of an institution and, where applicable, the structures within a group, taking into account the criteria specified in Section 7, are clear, efficient and transparent to the institution's staff, shareholders and other stakeholders and to the competent authority.\n\n73. The management body should guide the institution's structure, its evolution and its limitations and should ensure that the structure is justified and efficient and does not involve undue or inappropriate complexity.\n\n74.

This includes understanding group-specific operational risks and intra-group exposures as well as how the group's funding, capital, liquidity and risk profiles could be affected under normal and adverse circumstances. The management body should ensure that the institution is able to produce information on the group in a timely manner, regarding the type, the characteristics, the organisational chart, the ownership structure and the businesses of each legal entity, and that the institutions within the group comply with all supervisory reporting requirements on an individual, sub-consolidated and consolidated basis.\n\n75.

Such information and revisions thereof should be documented and made available to the relevant functions concerned, including the management body, business lines and internal control functions. The members of the management body of a consolidating institution should keep themselves informed about the risks the group's structure causes, taking into account the criteria specified in Section 7 of the guidelines. This includes receiving: a. information on major risk drivers; b. regular reports assessing the institution's overall structure and evaluating the compliance of individual entities' activities with the approved group-wide strategy; and c. regular reports on topics where the regulatory framework requires compliance at individual, sub-consolidated and consolidated levels. 31 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY",

Competent authorities should assess the framework and arrangements that the institution has specifically to manage and control operational risk as an individual risk category. This assessment should take into account the outcome of the analysis of the overall risk management and internal-control framework addressed in Title 5, as this will influence the institution's operational risk exposures. Regarding ML/TF risk, the competent authority should take into account the assessment provided by the AML/CFT supervisor.\n\n311. Competent authorities should approach this review having regard to the key operational risk drivers (i.e. people, processes, external factors, systems), which can also act as mitigating factors, and should consider: a. the operational risk management strategy and appetite; b. the organisational framework; c. policies and procedures; d. operational risk identification, measurement, monitoring and reporting; e. business resilience and continuity plans; and f. the internal control framework as it applies to the management of operational risk. Operational risk management strategy and appetite\n\n312. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has defined and formalised a sound operational risk management strategy and appetite level, approved by the management body. For this assessment, competent authorities should take into account whether: 118 a. the management body clearly expresses the operational risk management strategy and appetite level, as well as the process for the review thereof (e.g. in the event of an overall risk strategy review, a loss trend and/or capital adequacy concerns, etc.); b. senior management properly implements and monitors the operational risk management strategy approved by the management body, ensuring that the institution's operational risk mitigation measures are consistent with the strategy established; c. these strategies are appropriate and efficient with respect to the nature and materiality of the operational risk profile and whether the institution monitors their effectiveness over time and their consistency with the operational risk appetite level; d. the institution's operational risk management strategy covers all the activities, processes and systems of the institution - including on a forward-looking basis through the strategic plan - where operational risk is or may be significant; and e. the institution has an appropriate framework in place to ensure that the operational risk management strategy is effectively communicated to relevant staff.\n\n313. To assess the credibility of such strategies, competent authorities should also assess whether the institution has allocated sufficient resources to their implementation, and whether relevant decisions taken are irrespective of minimum own funds requirements benefits that might accrue (in particular for institutions adopting the BIA or TSA approaches to determine minimum own funds requirements). Organisational framework for management and oversight of operational risk\n\n314. Competent authorities should assess the soundness and effectiveness of the organisational framework with respect to the management of operational risk. In this regard, the competent authority should determine whether: a. there are clear lines of responsibility for the identification, analysis, assessment, mitigation, monitoring and reporting of operational risk; b. the operational risk control and monitoring systems are subject to independent review and there is a clear separation between risk-takers and risk managers, between these and the risk control and oversight risk functions; c. the risk management, measurement, and control functions cover operational risk across the entire institution (including branches) in an integrated manner, 119 irrespective of the measurement approach adopted to determine minimum own funds, and also cover outsourced business functions and other activities; and d. the operational risk management framework is structured with sufficient and qualitatively appropriate human and technical resources. Policies and procedures\n\n315. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has appropriate policies and procedures for the management of operational risk, including residual risk after mitigation techniques have been applied. For this assessment, competent authorities should take into account whether: a. the management body approves the policies for managing operational risk and reviews them regularly, in line with the operational risk management strategies; b. senior management is responsible for developing and implementing the policies and procedures for managing operational risk; c. operational risk management policies and procedures are clearly formalised and communicated throughout the institution and are applied consistently across the institution, or at least those processes and businesses most exposed to operational risk; d. policies and procedures cover all the elements of operational risk management, measurement and control including, where relevant, loss data collection, quantification methodologies, mitigation techniques (e.g. insurance policies), causal analysis techniques in respect of operational risk events, limits and the handling of exceptions to those limits; e. the institution has implemented an approval process for new products, processes and systems that requires assessment and mitigation of potential operational risks raised by the implementation and the development of the related new products, processes and systems; f. such policies are adequate for the nature and complexity of the institution's activities, and enable a clear understanding of the operational risk inherent to the different products and activities under the scope of the institution; g. the institution promotes an operational risk management culture throughout the organisation, by means of training and by setting targets for operational loss reduction. Risk identification, measurement, monitoring and reporting 120\n\n316. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has an appropriate framework for identifying, assessing, measuring and monitoring operational risk, in line with the institution's size and complexity, and whether the framework is compliant, as a minimum, with the relevant minimum own funds requirements under the relevant EU and national implementing legislation. Competent authorities should take into account whether: a. the institution has implemented effective processes and procedures for comprehensive identification and assessment of operational risk exposure (e.g. Risk and Control Self-Assessments (RCSA)) and for the detection and accurate categorisation of relevant events (i.e. loss data collection, 'near misses' with no loss impact or even events that generate unexpected gains), including boundary cases with other risks (e.g. credit loss caused or augmented by an operational risk event); in this regard, competent authorities should also determine the ability of the institution to identify the key drivers of relevant operational losses and use this information for operational risk management purposes; b. for the purposes of Article 101 of Directive 2013/36/EU, if the institution is authorised to use an internal model to determine minimum own funds requirements for operational risk, the institution continues to fulfil the minimum requirements specified in the relevant EU and national implementing legislation and whether such an internal model involves any material risk underestimation; c. the institution has appropriate information systems and methodologies to quantify or assess the operational risk, which comply, as a minimum, with requirements for determining relevant minimum own funds as specified in the relevant EU and national implementing legislation (e.g. for TSA, mapping of relevant profit and loss items to the eight regulatory business lines; for the AMA, the length of time series, treatment of insurance, correlation, etc.); d. the institution has implemented adequate stress testing and scenario analysis, as appropriate, to understand the impact of adverse operational events on its profitability and own funds, also taking into due consideration the potential failure of internal controls and mitigation techniques; where relevant, competent authorities should consider the consistency of these analyses with the RCSA and with the outcome of peer analysis; e. the institution's management body and senior management understand the assumptions underlying the measurement system and whether they are aware of the degree of relevant model risk; f. the institution has defined and implemented continuous and effective monitoring of operational risk exposures throughout the institution, including outsourced activities and new products and systems, amongst others, by means of specific 121 forward-looking indicators (key risk indicators and key control indicators) and relevant triggers to provide effective early warning alerts; g. the institution has defined adequate actions to respond to residual risks to keep them within the limits defined in the risk appetite; h. the institution has implemented regular reporting on operational risk exposure, including stress testing outcomes, to the management body, senior management and the managers of relevant businesses and processes as appropriate.\n\n317. Competent authorities should assess the institution's ICT risk management framework in accordance with the EBA Guidelines on ICT Risk Assessment under the SREP and having regard to the EBA Guidelines on ICT and security risk management. Business resilience and continuity plans\n\n318. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has in place comprehensive and tested business resilience and continuity plans, covering at least critical and important functions, including those that are outsourced, to ensure that it is able to operate on an ongoing basis and limit losses in the event of severe business disruption. For outsourced activities, competent authorities should ensure that the service provider has a suitable business continuity plan in line with the EBA Guidelines on outsourcing arrangements.\n\n319. Competent authorities should determine whether the institution has established business continuity plans commensurate with the nature, size and complexity of its operations. Such plans should take into account different types of likely or plausible scenarios to which the institution may be vulnerable.\n\n320. Competent authorities should assess the quality and effectiveness of the institution's continuity management planning process. In doing so, competent authorities should evaluate the quality of the institution's adherence to recognised Business Continuity Management (BCM) processes. Accordingly, competent authorities should determine whether the institution's continuity management planning process includes: a. a Business Impact Analysis; b. appropriate recovery strategies incorporating internal and external dependencies and clearly defined recovery priorities; c. the drafting of comprehensive and flexible plans to deal with plausible scenarios; d. effective testing of the design and operational effectiveness of the plans; e. BCM awareness and training programmes; and f. communications and crisis-management documentation and training. 122 Internal control framework\n\n321. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has a strong control framework and sound safeguards to mitigate its operational risk, in line with its operational risk management appetite and strategy. Competent authorities should take into account whether: a. the scope covered by the institution's control functions includes all consolidated entities and geographical locations; b. there are internal controls and other practices (e.g. risk responses, such as conduct policies, risk transfer techniques, etc.) aimed at mitigating operational risk exposures or curtailing potential impacts, and keeping them within levels acceptable to the institution, in accordance with the parameters set by the management body and senior management and the institution's risk appetite level; and c. the institution has appropriate internal controls and practices to ensure that breaches of and exceptions to policies, procedures and limits are reported in a timely manner to the appropriate level of management for action, and to competent authorities as required.\n\n322. Competent authorities should also assess the functionality of the internal audit function. To this end, they should determine whether: a. the institution conducts internal audits of the operational risk management framework on a regular basis; b. the internal audit covers the main elements of operational risk management measurement and control across the institution; and c. such audits are effective in determining adherence to internal policies and any relevant external regulations and addressing any deviations from them.\n\n323. For institutions using the AMA to determine minimum own funds requirements for operational risk, competent authorities should also assess whether the internal approach- validation process is sound and effective in challenging model assumptions and identifying any potential shortcomings with respect to operational risk modelling, quantification and systems and other relevant minimum requirements specified in the relevant EU and national implementing legislation.\n\n324. Irrespective of the approach adopted by the institution to determine regulatory minimum own funds, when models are used for decision-making (e.g. credit lending, pricing, trading financial instruments, etc.), competent authorities should assess whether there is a sound internal validation process and/or model-review process to identify and mitigate model risk. 123 Management of reputational risk\n\n325. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has implemented adequate arrangements, strategies, processes and mechanisms to manage reputational risk. In particular, competent authorities should take into account whether: a. the institution has formalised policies and processes in place for the identification, management and monitoring of this risk, and whether these policies and processes are proportionate to its size and its relevance in the system; b. the institution addresses this risk in a precautionary manner, for example by setting limits or requiring approval for allocating capital to specific countries, sectors or persons and/or whether its contingency plans address the need to deal proactively with reputational issues in the event of a crisis; c. the institution conducts stress testing or scenario analysis to assess any secondary effects of reputational risk (e.g. liquidity, funding costs, access to correspondent banking service, etc.); d. the institution acts to protect its brand through prompt communication campaigns where specific events occur that might endanger its reputation; and e. the institution considers the potential impact of its strategy and business plans, and more generally of its behaviour, on its reputation.",

Competent authorities should assess the institution's ICT risk management framework in accordance with the EBA Guidelines on ICT Risk Assessment under the SREP and having regard to the EBA Guidelines on ICT and security risk management. Business resilience and continuity plans\n\n318. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has in place comprehensive and tested business resilience and continuity plans, covering at least critical and important functions, including those that are outsourced, to ensure that it is able to operate on an ongoing basis and limit losses in the event of severe business disruption. For outsourced activities, competent authorities should ensure that the service provider has a suitable business continuity plan in line with the EBA Guidelines on outsourcing arrangements.\n\n319. Competent authorities should determine whether the institution has established business continuity plans commensurate with the nature, size and complexity of its operations. Such plans should take into account different types of likely or plausible scenarios to which the institution may be vulnerable.\n\n320. Competent authorities should assess the quality and effectiveness of the institution's continuity management planning process. In doing so, competent authorities should evaluate the quality of the institution's adherence to recognised Business Continuity Management (BCM) processes. Accordingly, competent authorities should determine whether the institution's continuity management planning process includes: a. a Business Impact Analysis; b. appropriate recovery strategies incorporating internal and external dependencies and clearly defined recovery priorities; c. the drafting of comprehensive and flexible plans to deal with plausible scenarios; d. effective testing of the design and operational effectiveness of the plans; e. BCM awareness and training programmes; and f. communications and crisis-management documentation and training. 122 Internal control framework\n\n321. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has a strong control framework and sound safeguards to mitigate its operational risk, in line with its operational risk management appetite and strategy. Competent authorities should take into account whether: a. the scope covered by the institution's control functions includes all consolidated entities and geographical locations; b. there are internal controls and other practices (e.g. risk responses, such as conduct policies, risk transfer techniques, etc.) aimed at mitigating operational risk exposures or curtailing potential impacts, and keeping them within levels acceptable to the institution, in accordance with the parameters set by the management body and senior management and the institution's risk appetite level; and c. the institution has appropriate internal controls and practices to ensure that breaches of and exceptions to policies, procedures and limits are reported in a timely manner to the appropriate level of management for action, and to competent authorities as required.\n\n322. Competent authorities should also assess the functionality of the internal audit function. To this end, they should determine whether: a. the institution conducts internal audits of the operational risk management framework on a regular basis; b. the internal audit covers the main elements of operational risk management measurement and control across the institution; and c. such audits are effective in determining adherence to internal policies and any relevant external regulations and addressing any deviations from them.\n\n323. For institutions using the AMA to determine minimum own funds requirements for operational risk, competent authorities should also assess whether the internal approach- validation process is sound and effective in challenging model assumptions and identifying any potential shortcomings with respect to operational risk modelling, quantification and systems and other relevant minimum requirements specified in the relevant EU and national implementing legislation.\n\n324. Irrespective of the approach adopted by the institution to determine regulatory minimum own funds, when models are used for decision-making (e.g. credit lending, pricing, trading financial instruments, etc.), competent authorities should assess whether there is a sound internal validation process and/or model-review process to identify and mitigate model risk. 123 Management of reputational risk\n\n325. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has implemented adequate arrangements, strategies, processes and mechanisms to manage reputational risk. In particular, competent authorities should take into account whether: a. the institution has formalised policies and processes in place for the identification, management and monitoring of this risk, and whether these policies and processes are proportionate to its size and its relevance in the system; b. the institution addresses this risk in a precautionary manner, for example by setting limits or requiring approval for allocating capital to specific countries, sectors or persons and/or whether its contingency plans address the need to deal proactively with reputational issues in the event of a crisis; c. the institution conducts stress testing or scenario analysis to assess any secondary effects of reputational risk (e.g. liquidity, funding costs, access to correspondent banking service, etc.); d. the institution acts to protect its brand through prompt communication campaigns where specific events occur that might endanger its reputation; and e. the institution considers the potential impact of its strategy and business plans, and more generally of its behaviour, on its reputation.",
    "paragraph_b_text": "539. In determining the overall SREP assessment, competent authorities should consider the findings of the assessments of the SREP elements, specifically: a. the risks to which the institution is or may be exposed; b. the likelihood that the institution's governance, control deficiencies and/or business model or strategy are likely to exacerbate or mitigate these risks, or expose the institution to new sources of risk; c. whether the institution's own funds and liquidity resources provide sound coverage of these risks; and d. the potential for positive and negative interaction between the elements (e.g. competent authorities may consider a strong capital position as a potential mitigating factor for certain concerns identified in the area of liquidity and funding, or by contrast, that a weak capital position may exacerbate concerns in that area).",

Competent authorities should assess the framework and arrangements that the institution has specifically to manage and control operational risk as an individual risk category. This assessment should take into account the outcome of the analysis of the overall risk management and internal-control framework addressed in Title 5, as this will influence the institution's operational risk exposures. Regarding ML/TF risk, the competent authority should take into account the assessment provided by the AML/CFT supervisor.\n\n311.

    "paragraph_b_text": "630. The supervisory stress testing programme set out by the competent authorities should ensure at least the following: a. When designing methodologies and assumptions for use in supervisory stress tests, competent authorities should decide on the design and features of the exercise that are most suitable for its intended purpose, i.e. that are linked to the supervisory (or other) objectives set by the competent authority. b. When conducting supervisory stress tests on a wider sample of institutions, competent authorities may consider adopting the design of supervisory stress tests for different categories of institutions as set out in Section 2.4, especially if the exercise is top-down. c. Competent authorities should consider the appropriate timelines for conducting supervisory stress tests, including the time horizon of the scenarios and the period over which the management actions proposed by institutions in the stress test exercise are analysed. The timelines for the exercise should also factor in the dialogue with the institution, where relevant for the intended purpose of the exercise and the extent to which the data supplied by the participating institution will remain relevant. d. Competent authorities should consider, where relevant for the intended purpose of the exercise, all known future regulatory changes affecting institutions within the scope and time horizon of the exercise.\n\n631. In the case of a scenario analysis stress test, competent authorities should decide whether to run a single scenario to be applied to all institutions included in the scope of the exercise, or to develop institution-specific scenarios for individual institutions (the latter should not be seen 225 as relieving institutions from the responsibility of designing own scenarios for the purposes of ICAAP and ILAAP stress testing), or a combination of the two. Competent authorities should consider the transferability of capital and liquidity resources in stressed conditions and any possible impediments, including legal and operational impediments, that may exist.\n\n632. Furthermore, the following aspects should be considered when developing the methodologies for supervisory stress tests: a. For the purposes of the assessment of capital adequacy, competent authorities should consider the impact of the stress test on the institution's P&L, balance sheet, risk exposure amount and leverage ratio, and analyse the impact of the stress test on the capital ratios of institutions covered by the exercise. b. For the purposes of bottom-up stress tests, competent authorities should consider the extent to which they prescribe the methodologies for modelling institutions' balance sheets and P&L. Indicatively, institutions' balance sheets may be taken as static, allowing competent authorities to assess current risks over time. Alternatively, they may be allowed to be dynamic, permitting, for example, a more forward-looking exploration of how institutions' business plans might evolve under the stress scenario or how credit volumes might evolve over time. For enhanced comparability, competent authorities may consider opting for the static balance sheet approach. Conversely, for enhanced feedback on institutions' intended or planned reactions vis-a-vis stresses and shocks, the dynamic balance sheet approach may be favoured. c. Competent authorities should consider how to take account of systemic feedback or second-round effects in the stress tests, where relevant, recognising the limitations of providing ex ante assumptions in the case of bottom-up stress tests. d. For the purposes of bottom-up supervisory stress tests, competent authorities should aim to assess the impact of such exercises consistently and fairly across the institutions covered by supervisory stress tests, respecting the level playing field. Competent authorities should also consider the extent to which stress test results reflect differences in modelling choices and judgements among institutions, rather than true differences in the risks to which they are exposed.\n\n633. Competent authorities should aim to assess model risk across stress testing exercises and have access to different types of comparative information. It is recommended to have, where appropriate, several perspectives/benchmarks. It is important to recognise that all models are imperfect and to clearly identify known and potential weaknesses. Understanding these limitations and weaknesses of individual institutions' stress testing models can inform the supervisory stress testing process and mitigate potential problems arising from model risk. 226 Annexes Annex 1. Operational risk, examples of the link between losses and risk drivers To illustrate how operational risk manifests itself, it is necessary to understand the relationship between the drivers of a specific risk event and the impact (i.e. outcome) of the risk event.

This assessment should take into account the outcome of the analysis of the overall risk management and internal-control framework addressed in Title 5, as this will influence the institution's operational risk exposures. Regarding ML/TF risk, the competent authority should take into account the assessment provided by the AML/CFT supervisor.\n\n311. Competent authorities should approach this review having regard to the key operational risk drivers (i.e. people, processes, external factors, systems), which can also act as mitigating factors, and should consider: a. the operational risk management strategy and appetite; b. the organisational framework; c. policies and procedures; d. operational risk identification, measurement, monitoring and reporting; e. business resilience and continuity plans; and f. the internal control framework as it applies to the management of operational risk. Operational risk management strategy and appetite\n\n312. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has defined and formalised a sound operational risk management strategy and appetite level, approved by the management body. For this assessment, competent authorities should take into account whether: 118 a. the management body clearly expresses the operational risk management strategy and appetite level, as well as the process for the review thereof (e.g. in the event of an overall risk strategy review, a loss trend and/or capital adequacy concerns, etc.); b. senior management properly implements and monitors the operational risk management strategy approved by the management body, ensuring that the institution's operational risk mitigation measures are consistent with the strategy established; c. these strategies are appropriate and efficient with respect to the nature and materiality of the operational risk profile and whether the institution monitors their effectiveness over time and their consistency with the operational risk appetite level; d. the institution's operational risk management strategy covers all the activities, processes and systems of the institution - including on a forward-looking basis through the strategic plan - where operational risk is or may be significant; and e. the institution has an appropriate framework in place to ensure that the operational risk management strategy is effectively communicated to relevant staff.\n\n313. To assess the credibility of such strategies, competent authorities should also assess whether the institution has allocated sufficient resources to their implementation, and whether relevant decisions taken are irrespective of minimum own funds requirements benefits that might accrue (in particular for institutions adopting the BIA or TSA approaches to determine minimum own funds requirements). Organisational framework for management and oversight of operational risk\n\n314. Competent authorities should assess the soundness and effectiveness of the organisational framework with respect to the management of operational risk. In this regard, the competent authority should determine whether: a. there are clear lines of responsibility for the identification, analysis, assessment, mitigation, monitoring and reporting of operational risk; b. the operational risk control and monitoring systems are subject to independent review and there is a clear separation between risk-takers and risk managers, between these and the risk control and oversight risk functions; c. the risk management, measurement, and control functions cover operational risk across the entire institution (including branches) in an integrated manner, 119 irrespective of the measurement approach adopted to determine minimum own funds, and also cover outsourced business functions and other activities; and d. the operational risk management framework is structured with sufficient and qualitatively appropriate human and technical resources. Policies and procedures\n\n315. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has appropriate policies and procedures for the management of operational risk, including residual risk after mitigation techniques have been applied. For this assessment, competent authorities should take into account whether: a. the management body approves the policies for managing operational risk and reviews them regularly, in line with the operational risk management strategies; b. senior management is responsible for developing and implementing the policies and procedures for managing operational risk; c. operational risk management policies and procedures are clearly formalised and communicated throughout the institution and are applied consistently across the institution, or at least those processes and businesses most exposed to operational risk; d. policies and procedures cover all the elements of operational risk management, measurement and control including, where relevant, loss data collection, quantification methodologies, mitigation techniques (e.g. insurance policies), causal analysis techniques in respect of operational risk events, limits and the handling of exceptions to those limits; e. the institution has implemented an approval process for new products, processes and systems that requires assessment and mitigation of potential operational risks raised by the implementation and the development of the related new products, processes and systems; f. such policies are adequate for the nature and complexity of the institution's activities, and enable a clear understanding of the operational risk inherent to the different products and activities under the scope of the institution; g. the institution promotes an operational risk management culture throughout the organisation, by means of training and by setting targets for operational loss reduction. Risk identification, measurement, monitoring and reporting 120\n\n316. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has an appropriate framework for identifying, assessing, measuring and monitoring operational risk, in line with the institution's size and complexity, and whether the framework is compliant, as a minimum, with the relevant minimum own funds requirements under the relevant EU and national implementing legislation. Competent authorities should take into account whether: a. the institution has implemented effective processes and procedures for comprehensive identification and assessment of operational risk exposure (e.g. Risk and Control Self-Assessments (RCSA)) and for the detection and accurate categorisation of relevant events (i.e. loss data collection, 'near misses' with no loss impact or even events that generate unexpected gains), including boundary cases with other risks (e.g. credit loss caused or augmented by an operational risk event); in this regard, competent authorities should also determine the ability of the institution to identify the key drivers of relevant operational losses and use this information for operational risk management purposes; b. for the purposes of Article 101 of Directive 2013/36/EU, if the institution is authorised to use an internal model to determine minimum own funds requirements for operational risk, the institution continues to fulfil the minimum requirements specified in the relevant EU and national implementing legislation and whether such an internal model involves any material risk underestimation; c. the institution has appropriate information systems and methodologies to quantify or assess the operational risk, which comply, as a minimum, with requirements for determining relevant minimum own funds as specified in the relevant EU and national implementing legislation (e.g. for TSA, mapping of relevant profit and loss items to the eight regulatory business lines; for the AMA, the length of time series, treatment of insurance, correlation, etc.); d. the institution has implemented adequate stress testing and scenario analysis, as appropriate, to understand the impact of adverse operational events on its profitability and own funds, also taking into due consideration the potential failure of internal controls and mitigation techniques; where relevant, competent authorities should consider the consistency of these analyses with the RCSA and with the outcome of peer analysis; e. the institution's management body and senior management understand the assumptions underlying the measurement system and whether they are aware of the degree of relevant model risk; f. the institution has defined and implemented continuous and effective monitoring of operational risk exposures throughout the institution, including outsourced activities and new products and systems, amongst others, by means of specific 121 forward-looking indicators (key risk indicators and key control indicators) and relevant triggers to provide effective early warning alerts; g. the institution has defined adequate actions to respond to residual risks to keep them within the limits defined in the risk appetite; h. the institution has implemented regular reporting on operational risk exposure, including stress testing outcomes, to the management body, senior management and the managers of relevant businesses and processes as appropriate.\n\n317. Competent authorities should assess the institution's ICT risk management framework in accordance with the EBA Guidelines on ICT Risk Assessment under the SREP and having regard to the EBA Guidelines on ICT and security risk management. Business resilience and continuity plans\n\n318. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has in place comprehensive and tested business resilience and continuity plans, covering at least critical and important functions, including those that are outsourced, to ensure that it is able to operate on an ongoing basis and limit losses in the event of severe business disruption. For outsourced activities, competent authorities should ensure that the service provider has a suitable business continuity plan in line with the EBA Guidelines on outsourcing arrangements.\n\n319. Competent authorities should determine whether the institution has established business continuity plans commensurate with the nature, size and complexity of its operations. Such plans should take into account different types of likely or plausible scenarios to which the institution may be vulnerable.\n\n320. Competent authorities should assess the quality and effectiveness of the institution's continuity management planning process. In doing so, competent authorities should evaluate the quality of the institution's adherence to recognised Business Continuity Management (BCM) processes. Accordingly, competent authorities should determine whether the institution's continuity management planning process includes: a. a Business Impact Analysis; b. appropriate recovery strategies incorporating internal and external dependencies and clearly defined recovery priorities; c. the drafting of comprehensive and flexible plans to deal with plausible scenarios; d. effective testing of the design and operational effectiveness of the plans; e. BCM awareness and training programmes; and f. communications and crisis-management documentation and training. 122 Internal control framework\n\n321. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has a strong control framework and sound safeguards to mitigate its operational risk, in line with its operational risk management appetite and strategy. Competent authorities should take into account whether: a. the scope covered by the institution's control functions includes all consolidated entities and geographical locations; b. there are internal controls and other practices (e.g. risk responses, such as conduct policies, risk transfer techniques, etc.) aimed at mitigating operational risk exposures or curtailing potential impacts, and keeping them within levels acceptable to the institution, in accordance with the parameters set by the management body and senior management and the institution's risk appetite level; and c. the institution has appropriate internal controls and practices to ensure that breaches of and exceptions to policies, procedures and limits are reported in a timely manner to the appropriate level of management for action, and to competent authorities as required.\n\n322. Competent authorities should also assess the functionality of the internal audit function. To this end, they should determine whether: a. the institution conducts internal audits of the operational risk management framework on a regular basis; b. the internal audit covers the main elements of operational risk management measurement and control across the institution; and c. such audits are effective in determining adherence to internal policies and any relevant external regulations and addressing any deviations from them.\n\n323. For institutions using the AMA to determine minimum own funds requirements for operational risk, competent authorities should also assess whether the internal approach- validation process is sound and effective in challenging model assumptions and identifying any potential shortcomings with respect to operational risk modelling, quantification and systems and other relevant minimum requirements specified in the relevant EU and national implementing legislation.\n\n324. Irrespective of the approach adopted by the institution to determine regulatory minimum own funds, when models are used for decision-making (e.g. credit lending, pricing, trading financial instruments, etc.), competent authorities should assess whether there is a sound internal validation process and/or model-review process to identify and mitigate model risk. 123 Management of reputational risk\n\n325.

Where an institution creates many legal entities within its group, their number and, in particular, the interconnections and transactions between them should not pose challenges for the design of its internal governance, and for the effective management and oversight of the risks of the group as a whole . The management body should ensure that the structure of an institution and, where applicable, the structures within a group, taking into account the criteria specified in Section 7, are clear, efficient and transparent to the institution's staff, shareholders and other stakeholders and to the competent authority.\n\n73. The management body should guide the institution's structure, its evolution and its limitations and should ensure that the structure is justified and efficient and does not involve undue or inappropriate complexity.\n\n74. The management body of a consolidating institution should understand not only the legal, organisational and operational structure of the group but also the purpose and activities of its different entities and the links and relationships among them. This includes understanding group-specific operational risks and intra-group exposures as well as how the group's funding, capital, liquidity and risk profiles could be affected under normal and adverse circumstances. The management body should ensure that the institution is able to produce information on the group in a timely manner, regarding the type, the characteristics, the organisational chart, the ownership structure and the businesses of each legal entity, and that the institutions within the group comply with all supervisory reporting requirements on an individual, sub-consolidated and consolidated basis.\n\n75. The management body of a consolidating institution should ensure that the different group entities (including the consolidating institution itself) receive enough information to get a clear perception of the general objectives, strategies and risk profile of the group and how the group entity concerned is embedded in the group's structure and operational functioning. Such information and revisions thereof should be documented and made available to the relevant functions concerned, including the management body, business lines and internal control functions. The members of the management body of a consolidating institution should keep themselves informed about the risks the group's structure causes, taking into account the criteria specified in Section 7 of the guidelines. This includes receiving: a. information on major risk drivers; b. regular reports assessing the institution's overall structure and evaluating the compliance of individual entities' activities with the approved group-wide strategy; and c. regular reports on topics where the regulatory framework requires compliance at individual, sub-consolidated and consolidated levels. 31 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY",

For this assessment, competent authorities should take into account whether: a. the management body approves the policies for managing operational risk and reviews them regularly, in line with the operational risk management strategies; b. senior management is responsible for developing and implementing the policies and procedures for managing operational risk; c. operational risk management policies and procedures are clearly formalised and communicated throughout the institution and are applied consistently across the institution, or at least those processes and businesses most exposed to operational risk; d. policies and procedures cover all the elements of operational risk management, measurement and control including, where relevant, loss data collection, quantification methodologies, mitigation techniques (e.g. insurance policies), causal analysis techniques in respect of operational risk events, limits and the handling of exceptions to those limits; e. the institution has implemented an approval process for new products, processes and systems that requires assessment and mitigation of potential operational risks raised by the implementation and the development of the related new products, processes and systems; f. such policies are adequate for the nature and complexity of the institution's activities, and enable a clear understanding of the operational risk inherent to the different products and activities under the scope of the institution; g. the institution promotes an operational risk management culture throughout the organisation, by means of training and by setting targets for operational loss reduction. Risk identification, measurement, monitoring and reporting 120\n\n316. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has an appropriate framework for identifying, assessing, measuring and monitoring operational risk, in line with the institution's size and complexity, and whether the framework is compliant, as a minimum, with the relevant minimum own funds requirements under the relevant EU and national implementing legislation. Competent authorities should take into account whether: a. the institution has implemented effective processes and procedures for comprehensive identification and assessment of operational risk exposure (e.g. Risk and Control Self-Assessments (RCSA)) and for the detection and accurate categorisation of relevant events (i.e. loss data collection, 'near misses' with no loss impact or even events that generate unexpected gains), including boundary cases with other risks (e.g. credit loss caused or augmented by an operational risk event); in this regard, competent authorities should also determine the ability of the institution to identify the key drivers of relevant operational losses and use this information for operational risk management purposes; b. for the purposes of Article 101 of Directive 2013/36/EU, if the institution is authorised to use an internal model to determine minimum own funds requirements for operational risk, the institution continues to fulfil the minimum requirements specified in the relevant EU and national implementing legislation and whether such an internal model involves any material risk underestimation; c. the institution has appropriate information systems and methodologies to quantify or assess the operational risk, which comply, as a minimum, with requirements for determining relevant minimum own funds as specified in the relevant EU and national implementing legislation (e.g. for TSA, mapping of relevant profit and loss items to the eight regulatory business lines; for the AMA, the length of time series, treatment of insurance, correlation, etc.); d. the institution has implemented adequate stress testing and scenario analysis, as appropriate, to understand the impact of adverse operational events on its profitability and own funds, also taking into due consideration the potential failure of internal controls and mitigation techniques; where relevant, competent authorities should consider the consistency of these analyses with the RCSA and with the outcome of peer analysis; e. the institution's management body and senior management understand the assumptions underlying the measurement system and whether they are aware of the degree of relevant model risk; f. the institution has defined and implemented continuous and effective monitoring of operational risk exposures throughout the institution, including outsourced activities and new products and systems, amongst others, by means of specific 121 forward-looking indicators (key risk indicators and key control indicators) and relevant triggers to provide effective early warning alerts; g. the institution has defined adequate actions to respond to residual risks to keep them within the limits defined in the risk appetite; h. the institution has implemented regular reporting on operational risk exposure, including stress testing outcomes, to the management body, senior management and the managers of relevant businesses and processes as appropriate.\n\n317. Competent authorities should assess the institution's ICT risk management framework in accordance with the EBA Guidelines on ICT Risk Assessment under the SREP and having regard to the EBA Guidelines on ICT and security risk management. Business resilience and continuity plans\n\n318. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has in place comprehensive and tested business resilience and continuity plans, covering at least critical and important functions, including those that are outsourced, to ensure that it is able to operate on an ongoing basis and limit losses in the event of severe business disruption. For outsourced activities, competent authorities should ensure that the service provider has a suitable business continuity plan in line with the EBA Guidelines on outsourcing arrangements.\n\n319. Competent authorities should determine whether the institution has established business continuity plans commensurate with the nature, size and complexity of its operations. Such plans should take into account different types of likely or plausible scenarios to which the institution may be vulnerable.\n\n320. Competent authorities should assess the quality and effectiveness of the institution's continuity management planning process. In doing so, competent authorities should evaluate the quality of the institution's adherence to recognised Business Continuity Management (BCM) processes. Accordingly, competent authorities should determine whether the institution's continuity management planning process includes: a. a Business Impact Analysis; b. appropriate recovery strategies incorporating internal and external dependencies and clearly defined recovery priorities; c. the drafting of comprehensive and flexible plans to deal with plausible scenarios; d. effective testing of the design and operational effectiveness of the plans; e. BCM awareness and training programmes; and f. communications and crisis-management documentation and training. 122 Internal control framework\n\n321. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has a strong control framework and sound safeguards to mitigate its operational risk, in line with its operational risk management appetite and strategy. Competent authorities should take into account whether: a. the scope covered by the institution's control functions includes all consolidated entities and geographical locations; b. there are internal controls and other practices (e.g. risk responses, such as conduct policies, risk transfer techniques, etc.) aimed at mitigating operational risk exposures or curtailing potential impacts, and keeping them within levels acceptable to the institution, in accordance with the parameters set by the management body and senior management and the institution's risk appetite level; and c. the institution has appropriate internal controls and practices to ensure that breaches of and exceptions to policies, procedures and limits are reported in a timely manner to the appropriate level of management for action, and to competent authorities as required.\n\n322. Competent authorities should also assess the functionality of the internal audit function. To this end, they should determine whether: a. the institution conducts internal audits of the operational risk management framework on a regular basis; b. the internal audit covers the main elements of operational risk management measurement and control across the institution; and c. such audits are effective in determining adherence to internal policies and any relevant external regulations and addressing any deviations from them.\n\n323. For institutions using the AMA to determine minimum own funds requirements for operational risk, competent authorities should also assess whether the internal approach- validation process is sound and effective in challenging model assumptions and identifying any potential shortcomings with respect to operational risk modelling, quantification and systems and other relevant minimum requirements specified in the relevant EU and national implementing legislation.\n\n324. Irrespective of the approach adopted by the institution to determine regulatory minimum own funds, when models are used for decision-making (e.g. credit lending, pricing, trading financial instruments, etc.), competent authorities should assess whether there is a sound internal validation process and/or model-review process to identify and mitigate model risk. 123 Management of reputational risk\n\n325. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has implemented adequate arrangements, strategies, processes and mechanisms to manage reputational risk. In particular, competent authorities should take into account whether: a. the institution has formalised policies and processes in place for the identification, management and monitoring of this risk, and whether these policies and processes are proportionate to its size and its relevance in the system; b. the institution addresses this risk in a precautionary manner, for example by setting limits or requiring approval for allocating capital to specific countries, sectors or persons and/or whether its contingency plans address the need to deal proactively with reputational issues in the event of a crisis; c. the institution conducts stress testing or scenario analysis to assess any secondary effects of reputational risk (e.g. liquidity, funding costs, access to correspondent banking service, etc.); d. the institution acts to protect its brand through prompt communication campaigns where specific events occur that might endanger its reputation; and e. the institution considers the potential impact of its strategy and business plans, and more generally of its behaviour, on its reputation.",
    "paragraph_b_text": "(1) Losses resulting from an operational risk event cannot always be measured. The risk may materialise after a time lag or indirectly for example through damage caused to the reputation or goodwill of the supervised entity.\n\n(2) In operational risk management, an important role is played by measures taken to correct observed shortcomings and faults in processes and risk management and by other risk-limiting measures, such as staff-related and IT backup arrangements and acquisition of insurance cover.\n\n(3) The Credit Institutions Act contains detailed provisions on operational risk management. In accordance with chapter 9, section 16, subsection 1 of the CIA, a credit institution shall have procedures for identification, assessment and management of operational risk. It shall prepare for modelling risk and for rarely materialising severe risk events. A credit institution must clearly describe what it considers to be operational risks. It shall have written policies and procedures for operational risk management.",

Competent authorities should take into account whether: a. the scope covered by the institution's control functions includes all consolidated entities and geographical locations; b. there are internal controls and other practices (e.g. risk responses, such as conduct policies, risk transfer techniques, etc.) aimed at mitigating operational risk exposures or curtailing potential impacts, and keeping them within levels acceptable to the institution, in accordance with the parameters set by the management body and senior management and the institution's risk appetite level; and c. the institution has appropriate internal controls and practices to ensure that breaches of and exceptions to policies, procedures and limits are reported in a timely manner to the appropriate level of management for action, and to competent authorities as required.\n\n322. Competent authorities should also assess the functionality of the internal audit function. To this end, they should determine whether: a. the institution conducts internal audits of the operational risk management framework on a regular basis; b. the internal audit covers the main elements of operational risk management measurement and control across the institution; and c. such audits are effective in determining adherence to internal policies and any relevant external regulations and addressing any deviations from them.\n\n323. For institutions using the AMA to determine minimum own funds requirements for operational risk, competent authorities should also assess whether the internal approach- validation process is sound and effective in challenging model assumptions and identifying any potential shortcomings with respect to operational risk modelling, quantification and systems and other relevant minimum requirements specified in the relevant EU and national implementing legislation.\n\n324. Irrespective of the approach adopted by the institution to determine regulatory minimum own funds, when models are used for decision-making (e.g. credit lending, pricing, trading financial instruments, etc.), competent authorities should assess whether there is a sound internal validation process and/or model-review process to identify and mitigate model risk. 123 Management of reputational risk\n\n325. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has implemented adequate arrangements, strategies, processes and mechanisms to manage reputational risk. In particular, competent authorities should take into account whether: a. the institution has formalised policies and processes in place for the identification, management and monitoring of this risk, and whether these policies and processes are proportionate to its size and its relevance in the system; b. the institution addresses this risk in a precautionary manner, for example by setting limits or requiring approval for allocating capital to specific countries, sectors or persons and/or whether its contingency plans address the need to deal proactively with reputational issues in the event of a crisis; c. the institution conducts stress testing or scenario analysis to assess any secondary effects of reputational risk (e.g. liquidity, funding costs, access to correspondent banking service, etc.); d. the institution acts to protect its brand through prompt communication campaigns where specific events occur that might endanger its reputation; and e. the institution considers the potential impact of its strategy and business plans, and more generally of its behaviour, on its reputation.",

Competent authorities should assess the framework and arrangements that the institution has specifically to manage and control operational risk as an individual risk category. This assessment should take into account the outcome of the analysis of the overall risk management and internal-control framework addressed in Title 5, as this will influence the institution's operational risk exposures. Regarding ML/TF risk, the competent authority should take into account the assessment provided by the AML/CFT supervisor.\n\n311. Competent authorities should approach this review having regard to the key operational risk drivers (i.e. people, processes, external factors, systems), which can also act as mitigating factors, and should consider: a. the operational risk management strategy and appetite; b. the organisational framework; c. policies and procedures; d. operational risk identification, measurement, monitoring and reporting; e. business resilience and continuity plans; and f. the internal control framework as it applies to the management of operational risk. Operational risk management strategy and appetite\n\n312. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has defined and formalised a sound operational risk management strategy and appetite level, approved by the management body. For this assessment, competent authorities should take into account whether: 118 a. the management body clearly expresses the operational risk management strategy and appetite level, as well as the process for the review thereof (e.g. in the event of an overall risk strategy review, a loss trend and/or capital adequacy concerns, etc.); b. senior management properly implements and monitors the operational risk management strategy approved by the management body, ensuring that the institution's operational risk mitigation measures are consistent with the strategy established; c. these strategies are appropriate and efficient with respect to the nature and materiality of the operational risk profile and whether the institution monitors their effectiveness over time and their consistency with the operational risk appetite level; d. the institution's operational risk management strategy covers all the activities, processes and systems of the institution - including on a forward-looking basis through the strategic plan - where operational risk is or may be significant; and e. the institution has an appropriate framework in place to ensure that the operational risk management strategy is effectively communicated to relevant staff.\n\n313. To assess the credibility of such strategies, competent authorities should also assess whether the institution has allocated sufficient resources to their implementation, and whether relevant decisions taken are irrespective of minimum own funds requirements benefits that might accrue (in particular for institutions adopting the BIA or TSA approaches to determine minimum own funds requirements). Organisational framework for management and oversight of operational risk\n\n314. Competent authorities should assess the soundness and effectiveness of the organisational framework with respect to the management of operational risk. In this regard, the competent authority should determine whether: a. there are clear lines of responsibility for the identification, analysis, assessment, mitigation, monitoring and reporting of operational risk; b. the operational risk control and monitoring systems are subject to independent review and there is a clear separation between risk-takers and risk managers, between these and the risk control and oversight risk functions; c. the risk management, measurement, and control functions cover operational risk across the entire institution (including branches) in an integrated manner, 119 irrespective of the measurement approach adopted to determine minimum own funds, and also cover outsourced business functions and other activities; and d. the operational risk management framework is structured with sufficient and qualitatively appropriate human and technical resources. Policies and procedures\n\n315. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has appropriate policies and procedures for the management of operational risk, including residual risk after mitigation techniques have been applied. For this assessment, competent authorities should take into account whether: a. the management body approves the policies for managing operational risk and reviews them regularly, in line with the operational risk management strategies; b. senior management is responsible for developing and implementing the policies and procedures for managing operational risk; c. operational risk management policies and procedures are clearly formalised and communicated throughout the institution and are applied consistently across the institution, or at least those processes and businesses most exposed to operational risk; d. policies and procedures cover all the elements of operational risk management, measurement and control including, where relevant, loss data collection, quantification methodologies, mitigation techniques (e.g. insurance policies), causal analysis techniques in respect of operational risk events, limits and the handling of exceptions to those limits; e. the institution has implemented an approval process for new products, processes and systems that requires assessment and mitigation of potential operational risks raised by the implementation and the development of the related new products, processes and systems; f. such policies are adequate for the nature and complexity of the institution's activities, and enable a clear understanding of the operational risk inherent to the different products and activities under the scope of the institution; g. the institution promotes an operational risk management culture throughout the organisation, by means of training and by setting targets for operational loss reduction. Risk identification, measurement, monitoring and reporting 120\n\n316. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has an appropriate framework for identifying, assessing, measuring and monitoring operational risk, in line with the institution's size and complexity, and whether the framework is compliant, as a minimum, with the relevant minimum own funds requirements under the relevant EU and national implementing legislation. Competent authorities should take into account whether: a. the institution has implemented effective processes and procedures for comprehensive identification and assessment of operational risk exposure (e.g. Risk and Control Self-Assessments (RCSA)) and for the detection and accurate categorisation of relevant events (i.e. loss data collection, 'near misses' with no loss impact or even events that generate unexpected gains), including boundary cases with other risks (e.g. credit loss caused or augmented by an operational risk event); in this regard, competent authorities should also determine the ability of the institution to identify the key drivers of relevant operational losses and use this information for operational risk management purposes; b. for the purposes of Article 101 of Directive 2013/36/EU, if the institution is authorised to use an internal model to determine minimum own funds requirements for operational risk, the institution continues to fulfil the minimum requirements specified in the relevant EU and national implementing legislation and whether such an internal model involves any material risk underestimation; c. the institution has appropriate information systems and methodologies to quantify or assess the operational risk, which comply, as a minimum, with requirements for determining relevant minimum own funds as specified in the relevant EU and national implementing legislation (e.g. for TSA, mapping of relevant profit and loss items to the eight regulatory business lines; for the AMA, the length of time series, treatment of insurance, correlation, etc.); d. the institution has implemented adequate stress testing and scenario analysis, as appropriate, to understand the impact of adverse operational events on its profitability and own funds, also taking into due consideration the potential failure of internal controls and mitigation techniques; where relevant, competent authorities should consider the consistency of these analyses with the RCSA and with the outcome of peer analysis; e. the institution's management body and senior management understand the assumptions underlying the measurement system and whether they are aware of the degree of relevant model risk; f. the institution has defined and implemented continuous and effective monitoring of operational risk exposures throughout the institution, including outsourced activities and new products and systems, amongst others, by means of specific 121 forward-looking indicators (key risk indicators and key control indicators) and relevant triggers to provide effective early warning alerts; g. the institution has defined adequate actions to respond to residual risks to keep them within the limits defined in the risk appetite; h. the institution has implemented regular reporting on operational risk exposure, including stress testing outcomes, to the management body, senior management and the managers of relevant businesses and processes as appropriate.\n\n317. Competent authorities should assess the institution's ICT risk management framework in accordance with the EBA Guidelines on ICT Risk Assessment under the SREP and having regard to the EBA Guidelines on ICT and security risk management. Business resilience and continuity plans\n\n318. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has in place comprehensive and tested business resilience and continuity plans, covering at least critical and important functions, including those that are outsourced, to ensure that it is able to operate on an ongoing basis and limit losses in the event of severe business disruption. For outsourced activities, competent authorities should ensure that the service provider has a suitable business continuity plan in line with the EBA Guidelines on outsourcing arrangements.\n\n319. Competent authorities should determine whether the institution has established business continuity plans commensurate with the nature, size and complexity of its operations. Such plans should take into account different types of likely or plausible scenarios to which the institution may be vulnerable.\n\n320. Competent authorities should assess the quality and effectiveness of the institution's continuity management planning process. In doing so, competent authorities should evaluate the quality of the institution's adherence to recognised Business Continuity Management (BCM) processes. Accordingly, competent authorities should determine whether the institution's continuity management planning process includes: a. a Business Impact Analysis; b. appropriate recovery strategies incorporating internal and external dependencies and clearly defined recovery priorities; c. the drafting of comprehensive and flexible plans to deal with plausible scenarios; d. effective testing of the design and operational effectiveness of the plans; e. BCM awareness and training programmes; and f. communications and crisis-management documentation and training. 122 Internal control framework\n\n321.

Irrespective of the approach adopted by the institution to determine regulatory minimum own funds, when models are used for decision-making (e.g. credit lending, pricing, trading financial instruments, etc.), competent authorities should assess whether there is a sound internal validation process and/or model-review process to identify and mitigate model risk. 123 Management of reputational risk\n\n325. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has implemented adequate arrangements, strategies, processes and mechanisms to manage reputational risk. In particular, competent authorities should take into account whether: a. the institution has formalised policies and processes in place for the identification, management and monitoring of this risk, and whether these policies and processes are proportionate to its size and its relevance in the system; b. the institution addresses this risk in a precautionary manner, for example by setting limits or requiring approval for allocating capital to specific countries, sectors or persons and/or whether its contingency plans address the need to deal proactively with reputational issues in the event of a crisis; c. the institution conducts stress testing or scenario analysis to assess any secondary effects of reputational risk (e.g. liquidity, funding costs, access to correspondent banking service, etc.); d. the institution acts to protect its brand through prompt communication campaigns where specific events occur that might endanger its reputation; and e. the institution considers the potential impact of its strategy and business plans, and more generally of its behaviour, on its reputation.",

    "paragraph_a_text": "310. Competent authorities should assess the framework and arrangements that the institution has specifically to manage and control operational risk as an individual risk category. This assessment should take into account the outcome of the analysis of the overall risk management and internal-control framework addressed in Title 5, as this will influence the institution's operational risk exposures. Regarding ML/TF risk, the competent authority should take into account the assessment provided by the AML/CFT supervisor.\n\n311. Competent authorities should approach this review having regard to the key operational risk drivers (i.e. people, processes, external factors, systems), which can also act as mitigating factors, and should consider: a. the operational risk management strategy and appetite; b. the organisational framework; c. policies and procedures; d. operational risk identification, measurement, monitoring and reporting; e. business resilience and continuity plans; and f. the internal control framework as it applies to the management of operational risk. Operational risk management strategy and appetite\n\n312. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has defined and formalised a sound operational risk management strategy and appetite level, approved by the management body. For this assessment, competent authorities should take into account whether: 118 a. the management body clearly expresses the operational risk management strategy and appetite level, as well as the process for the review thereof (e.g. in the event of an overall risk strategy review, a loss trend and/or capital adequacy concerns, etc.); b. senior management properly implements and monitors the operational risk management strategy approved by the management body, ensuring that the institution's operational risk mitigation measures are consistent with the strategy established; c. these strategies are appropriate and efficient with respect to the nature and materiality of the operational risk profile and whether the institution monitors their effectiveness over time and their consistency with the operational risk appetite level; d. the institution's operational risk management strategy covers all the activities, processes and systems of the institution - including on a forward-looking basis through the strategic plan - where operational risk is or may be significant; and e. the institution has an appropriate framework in place to ensure that the operational risk management strategy is effectively communicated to relevant staff.\n\n313. To assess the credibility of such strategies, competent authorities should also assess whether the institution has allocated sufficient resources to their implementation, and whether relevant decisions taken are irrespective of minimum own funds requirements benefits that might accrue (in particular for institutions adopting the BIA or TSA approaches to determine minimum own funds requirements). Organisational framework for management and oversight of operational risk\n\n314. Competent authorities should assess the soundness and effectiveness of the organisational framework with respect to the management of operational risk. In this regard, the competent authority should determine whether: a. there are clear lines of responsibility for the identification, analysis, assessment, mitigation, monitoring and reporting of operational risk; b. the operational risk control and monitoring systems are subject to independent review and there is a clear separation between risk-takers and risk managers, between these and the risk control and oversight risk functions; c. the risk management, measurement, and control functions cover operational risk across the entire institution (including branches) in an integrated manner, 119 irrespective of the measurement approach adopted to determine minimum own funds, and also cover outsourced business functions and other activities; and d. the operational risk management framework is structured with sufficient and qualitatively appropriate human and technical resources. Policies and procedures\n\n315. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has appropriate policies and procedures for the management of operational risk, including residual risk after mitigation techniques have been applied. For this assessment, competent authorities should take into account whether: a. the management body approves the policies for managing operational risk and reviews them regularly, in line with the operational risk management strategies; b. senior management is responsible for developing and implementing the policies and procedures for managing operational risk; c. operational risk management policies and procedures are clearly formalised and communicated throughout the institution and are applied consistently across the institution, or at least those processes and businesses most exposed to operational risk; d. policies and procedures cover all the elements of operational risk management, measurement and control including, where relevant, loss data collection, quantification methodologies, mitigation techniques (e.g. insurance policies), causal analysis techniques in respect of operational risk events, limits and the handling of exceptions to those limits; e. the institution has implemented an approval process for new products, processes and systems that requires assessment and mitigation of potential operational risks raised by the implementation and the development of the related new products, processes and systems; f. such policies are adequate for the nature and complexity of the institution's activities, and enable a clear understanding of the operational risk inherent to the different products and activities under the scope of the institution; g. the institution promotes an operational risk management culture throughout the organisation, by means of training and by setting targets for operational loss reduction. Risk identification, measurement, monitoring and reporting 120\n\n316. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has an appropriate framework for identifying, assessing, measuring and monitoring operational risk, in line with the institution's size and complexity, and whether the framework is compliant, as a minimum, with the relevant minimum own funds requirements under the relevant EU and national implementing legislation. Competent authorities should take into account whether: a. the institution has implemented effective processes and procedures for comprehensive identification and assessment of operational risk exposure (e.g. Risk and Control Self-Assessments (RCSA)) and for the detection and accurate categorisation of relevant events (i.e. loss data collection, 'near misses' with no loss impact or even events that generate unexpected gains), including boundary cases with other risks (e.g. credit loss caused or augmented by an operational risk event); in this regard, competent authorities should also determine the ability of the institution to identify the key drivers of relevant operational losses and use this information for operational risk management purposes; b. for the purposes of Article 101 of Directive 2013/36/EU, if the institution is authorised to use an internal model to determine minimum own funds requirements for operational risk, the institution continues to fulfil the minimum requirements specified in the relevant EU and national implementing legislation and whether such an internal model involves any material risk underestimation; c. the institution has appropriate information systems and methodologies to quantify or assess the operational risk, which comply, as a minimum, with requirements for determining relevant minimum own funds as specified in the relevant EU and national implementing legislation (e.g. for TSA, mapping of relevant profit and loss items to the eight regulatory business lines; for the AMA, the length of time series, treatment of insurance, correlation, etc.); d. the institution has implemented adequate stress testing and scenario analysis, as appropriate, to understand the impact of adverse operational events on its profitability and own funds, also taking into due consideration the potential failure of internal controls and mitigation techniques; where relevant, competent authorities should consider the consistency of these analyses with the RCSA and with the outcome of peer analysis; e. the institution's management body and senior management understand the assumptions underlying the measurement system and whether they are aware of the degree of relevant model risk; f. the institution has defined and implemented continuous and effective monitoring of operational risk exposures throughout the institution, including outsourced activities and new products and systems, amongst others, by means of specific 121 forward-looking indicators (key risk indicators and key control indicators) and relevant triggers to provide effective early warning alerts; g. the institution has defined adequate actions to respond to residual risks to keep them within the limits defined in the risk appetite; h. the institution has implemented regular reporting on operational risk exposure, including stress testing outcomes, to the management body, senior management and the managers of relevant businesses and processes as appropriate.\n\n317. Competent authorities should assess the institution's ICT risk management framework in accordance with the EBA Guidelines on ICT Risk Assessment under the SREP and having regard to the EBA Guidelines on ICT and security risk management. Business resilience and continuity plans\n\n318. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has in place comprehensive and tested business resilience and continuity plans, covering at least critical and important functions, including those that are outsourced, to ensure that it is able to operate on an ongoing basis and limit losses in the event of severe business disruption. For outsourced activities, competent authorities should ensure that the service provider has a suitable business continuity plan in line with the EBA Guidelines on outsourcing arrangements.\n\n319. Competent authorities should determine whether the institution has established business continuity plans commensurate with the nature, size and complexity of its operations. Such plans should take into account different types of likely or plausible scenarios to which the institution may be vulnerable.\n\n320. Competent authorities should assess the quality and effectiveness of the institution's continuity management planning process. In doing so, competent authorities should evaluate the quality of the institution's adherence to recognised Business Continuity Management (BCM) processes. Accordingly, competent authorities should determine whether the institution's continuity management planning process includes: a. a Business Impact Analysis; b. appropriate recovery strategies incorporating internal and external dependencies and clearly defined recovery priorities; c. the drafting of comprehensive and flexible plans to deal with plausible scenarios; d. effective testing of the design and operational effectiveness of the plans; e. BCM awareness and training programmes; and f. communications and crisis-management documentation and training. 122 Internal control framework\n\n321. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has a strong control framework and sound safeguards to mitigate its operational risk, in line with its operational risk management appetite and strategy. Competent authorities should take into account whether: a. the scope covered by the institution's control functions includes all consolidated entities and geographical locations; b. there are internal controls and other practices (e.g. risk responses, such as conduct policies, risk transfer techniques, etc.) aimed at mitigating operational risk exposures or curtailing potential impacts, and keeping them within levels acceptable to the institution, in accordance with the parameters set by the management body and senior management and the institution's risk appetite level; and c. the institution has appropriate internal controls and practices to ensure that breaches of and exceptions to policies, procedures and limits are reported in a timely manner to the appropriate level of management for action, and to competent authorities as required.\n\n322. Competent authorities should also assess the functionality of the internal audit function. To this end, they should determine whether: a. the institution conducts internal audits of the operational risk management framework on a regular basis; b. the internal audit covers the main elements of operational risk management measurement and control across the institution; and c. such audits are effective in determining adherence to internal policies and any relevant external regulations and addressing any deviations from them.\n\n323. For institutions using the AMA to determine minimum own funds requirements for operational risk, competent authorities should also assess whether the internal approach- validation process is sound and effective in challenging model assumptions and identifying any potential shortcomings with respect to operational risk modelling, quantification and systems and other relevant minimum requirements specified in the relevant EU and national implementing legislation.\n\n324. Irrespective of the approach adopted by the institution to determine regulatory minimum own funds, when models are used for decision-making (e.g. credit lending, pricing, trading financial instruments, etc.), competent authorities should assess whether there is a sound internal validation process and/or model-review process to identify and mitigate model risk. 123 Management of reputational risk\n\n325. Competent authorities should assess whether the institution has implemented adequate arrangements, strategies, processes and mechanisms to manage reputational risk.

    "paragraph_b_text": "630. The supervisory stress testing programme set out by the competent authorities should ensure at least the following: a. When designing methodologies and assumptions for use in supervisory stress tests, competent authorities should decide on the design and features of the exercise that are most suitable for its intended purpose, i.e. that are linked to the supervisory (or other) objectives set by the competent authority. b. When conducting supervisory stress tests on a wider sample of institutions, competent authorities may consider adopting the design of supervisory stress tests for different categories of institutions as set out in Section 2.4, especially if the exercise is top-down. c. Competent authorities should consider the appropriate timelines for conducting supervisory stress tests, including the time horizon of the scenarios and the period over which the management actions proposed by institutions in the stress test exercise are analysed. The timelines for the exercise should also factor in the dialogue with the institution, where relevant for the intended purpose of the exercise and the extent to which the data supplied by the participating institution will remain relevant. d. Competent authorities should consider, where relevant for the intended purpose of the exercise, all known future regulatory changes affecting institutions within the scope and time horizon of the exercise.\n\n631. In the case of a scenario analysis stress test, competent authorities should decide whether to run a single scenario to be applied to all institutions included in the scope of the exercise, or to develop institution-specific scenarios for individual institutions (the latter should not be seen 225 as relieving institutions from the responsibility of designing own scenarios for the purposes of ICAAP and ILAAP stress testing), or a combination of the two. Competent authorities should consider the transferability of capital and liquidity resources in stressed conditions and any possible impediments, including legal and operational impediments, that may exist.\n\n632. Furthermore, the following aspects should be considered when developing the methodologies for supervisory stress tests: a. For the purposes of the assessment of capital adequacy, competent authorities should consider the impact of the stress test on the institution's P&L, balance sheet, risk exposure amount and leverage ratio, and analyse the impact of the stress test on the capital ratios of institutions covered by the exercise. b. For the purposes of bottom-up stress tests, competent authorities should consider the extent to which they prescribe the methodologies for modelling institutions' balance sheets and P&L. Indicatively, institutions' balance sheets may be taken as static, allowing competent authorities to assess current risks over time. Alternatively, they may be allowed to be dynamic, permitting, for example, a more forward-looking exploration of how institutions' business plans might evolve under the stress scenario or how credit volumes might evolve over time. For enhanced comparability, competent authorities may consider opting for the static balance sheet approach. Conversely, for enhanced feedback on institutions' intended or planned reactions vis-a-vis stresses and shocks, the dynamic balance sheet approach may be favoured. c. Competent authorities should consider how to take account of systemic feedback or second-round effects in the stress tests, where relevant, recognising the limitations of providing ex ante assumptions in the case of bottom-up stress tests. d. For the purposes of bottom-up supervisory stress tests, competent authorities should aim to assess the impact of such exercises consistently and fairly across the institutions covered by supervisory stress tests, respecting the level playing field. Competent authorities should also consider the extent to which stress test results reflect differences in modelling choices and judgements among institutions, rather than true differences in the risks to which they are exposed.\n\n633. Competent authorities should aim to assess model risk across stress testing exercises and have access to different types of comparative information. It is recommended to have, where appropriate, several perspectives/benchmarks. It is important to recognise that all models are imperfect and to clearly identify known and potential weaknesses. Understanding these limitations and weaknesses of individual institutions' stress testing models can inform the supervisory stress testing process and mitigate potential problems arising from model risk. 226 Annexes Annex 1. Operational risk, examples of the link between losses and risk drivers To illustrate how operational risk manifests itself, it is necessary to understand the relationship between the drivers of a specific risk event and the impact (i.e. outcome) of the risk event.

    "paragraph_b_text": "72. The management body should be responsible for the approval of sound strategies and policies for the establishment of newstructures. Where an institution creates many legal entities within its group, their number and, in particular, the interconnections and transactions between them should not pose challenges for the design of its internal governance, and for the effective management and oversight of the risks of the group as a whole . The management body should ensure that the structure of an institution and, where applicable, the structures within a group, taking into account the criteria specified in Section 7, are clear, efficient and transparent to the institution's staff, shareholders and other stakeholders and to the competent authority.\n\n73. The management body should guide the institution's structure, its evolution and its limitations and should ensure that the structure is justified and efficient and does not involve undue or inappropriate complexity.\n\n74. The management body of a consolidating institution should understand not only the legal, organisational and operational structure of the group but also the purpose and activities of its different entities and the links and relationships among them. This includes understanding group-specific operational risks and intra-group exposures as well as how the group's funding, capital, liquidity and risk profiles could be affected under normal and adverse circumstances. The management body should ensure that the institution is able to produce information on the group in a timely manner, regarding the type, the characteristics, the organisational chart, the ownership structure and the businesses of each legal entity, and that the institutions within the group comply with all supervisory reporting requirements on an individual, sub-consolidated and consolidated basis.\n\n75. The management body of a consolidating institution should ensure that the different group entities (including the consolidating institution itself) receive enough information to get a clear perception of the general objectives, strategies and risk profile of the group and how the group entity concerned is embedded in the group's structure and operational functioning. Such information and revisions thereof should be documented and made available to the relevant functions concerned, including the management body, business lines and internal control functions. The members of the management body of a consolidating institution should keep themselves informed about the risks the group's structure causes, taking into account the criteria specified in Section 7 of the guidelines. This includes receiving: a. information on major risk drivers; b. regular reports assessing the institution's overall structure and evaluating the compliance of individual entities' activities with the approved group-wide strategy; and c. regular reports on topics where the regulatory framework requires compliance at individual, sub-consolidated and consolidated levels. 31 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY",

In determining the overall SREP assessment, competent authorities should consider the findings of the assessments of the SREP elements, specifically: a. the risks to which the institution is or may be exposed; b. the likelihood that the institution's governance, control deficiencies and/or business model or strategy are likely to exacerbate or mitigate these risks, or expose the institution to new sources of risk; c. whether the institution's own funds and liquidity resources provide sound coverage of these risks; and d. the potential for positive and negative interaction between the elements (e.g. competent authorities may consider a strong capital position as a potential mitigating factor for certain concerns identified in the area of liquidity and funding, or by contrast, that a weak capital position may exacerbate concerns in that area).",
    "paragraph_b_text": "630. The supervisory stress testing programme set out by the competent authorities should ensure at least the following: a. When designing methodologies and assumptions for use in supervisory stress tests, competent authorities should decide on the design and features of the exercise that are most suitable for its intended purpose, i.e. that are linked to the supervisory (or other) objectives set by the competent authority. b. When conducting supervisory stress tests on a wider sample of institutions, competent authorities may consider adopting the design of supervisory stress tests for different categories of institutions as set out in Section 2.4, especially if the exercise is top-down. c. Competent authorities should consider the appropriate timelines for conducting supervisory stress tests, including the time horizon of the scenarios and the period over which the management actions proposed by institutions in the stress test exercise are analysed. The timelines for the exercise should also factor in the dialogue with the institution, where relevant for the intended purpose of the exercise and the extent to which the data supplied by the participating institution will remain relevant. d. Competent authorities should consider, where relevant for the intended purpose of the exercise, all known future regulatory changes affecting institutions within the scope and time horizon of the exercise.\n\n631. In the case of a scenario analysis stress test, competent authorities should decide whether to run a single scenario to be applied to all institutions included in the scope of the exercise, or to develop institution-specific scenarios for individual institutions (the latter should not be seen 225 as relieving institutions from the responsibility of designing own scenarios for the purposes of ICAAP and ILAAP stress testing), or a combination of the two. Competent authorities should consider the transferability of capital and liquidity resources in stressed conditions and any possible impediments, including legal and operational impediments, that may exist.\n\n632. Furthermore, the following aspects should be considered when developing the methodologies for supervisory stress tests: a. For the purposes of the assessment of capital adequacy, competent authorities should consider the impact of the stress test on the institution's P&L, balance sheet, risk exposure amount and leverage ratio, and analyse the impact of the stress test on the capital ratios of institutions covered by the exercise. b. For the purposes of bottom-up stress tests, competent authorities should consider the extent to which they prescribe the methodologies for modelling institutions' balance sheets and P&L. Indicatively, institutions' balance sheets may be taken as static, allowing competent authorities to assess current risks over time. Alternatively, they may be allowed to be dynamic, permitting, for example, a more forward-looking exploration of how institutions' business plans might evolve under the stress scenario or how credit volumes might evolve over time. For enhanced comparability, competent authorities may consider opting for the static balance sheet approach. Conversely, for enhanced feedback on institutions' intended or planned reactions vis-a-vis stresses and shocks, the dynamic balance sheet approach may be favoured. c. Competent authorities should consider how to take account of systemic feedback or second-round effects in the stress tests, where relevant, recognising the limitations of providing ex ante assumptions in the case of bottom-up stress tests. d. For the purposes of bottom-up supervisory stress tests, competent authorities should aim to assess the impact of such exercises consistently and fairly across the institutions covered by supervisory stress tests, respecting the level playing field. Competent authorities should also consider the extent to which stress test results reflect differences in modelling choices and judgements among institutions, rather than true differences in the risks to which they are exposed.\n\n633. Competent authorities should aim to assess model risk across stress testing exercises and have access to different types of comparative information. It is recommended to have, where appropriate, several perspectives/benchmarks. It is important to recognise that all models are imperfect and to clearly identify known and potential weaknesses. Understanding these limitations and weaknesses of individual institutions' stress testing models can inform the supervisory stress testing process and mitigate potential problems arising from model risk. 226 Annexes Annex 1. Operational risk, examples of the link between losses and risk drivers To illustrate how operational risk manifests itself, it is necessary to understand the relationship between the drivers of a specific risk event and the impact (i.e. outcome) of the risk event. Some examples are given in the following table56. Driver Risk event Impact types (outcomes) People Arson - a deliberate act committed by a person Fire - the event · Death/injury .

The management body should ensure that the structure of an institution and, where applicable, the structures within a group, taking into account the criteria specified in Section 7, are clear, efficient and transparent to the institution's staff, shareholders and other stakeholders and to the competent authority.\n\n73. The management body should guide the institution's structure, its evolution and its limitations and should ensure that the structure is justified and efficient and does not involve undue or inappropriate complexity.\n\n74. The management body of a consolidating institution should understand not only the legal, organisational and operational structure of the group but also the purpose and activities of its different entities and the links and relationships among them. This includes understanding group-specific operational risks and intra-group exposures as well as how the group's funding, capital, liquidity and risk profiles could be affected under normal and adverse circumstances. The management body should ensure that the institution is able to produce information on the group in a timely manner, regarding the type, the characteristics, the organisational chart, the ownership structure and the businesses of each legal entity, and that the institutions within the group comply with all supervisory reporting requirements on an individual, sub-consolidated and consolidated basis.\n\n75. The management body of a consolidating institution should ensure that the different group entities (including the consolidating institution itself) receive enough information to get a clear perception of the general objectives, strategies and risk profile of the group and how the group entity concerned is embedded in the group's structure and operational functioning. Such information and revisions thereof should be documented and made available to the relevant functions concerned, including the management body, business lines and internal control functions. The members of the management body of a consolidating institution should keep themselves informed about the risks the group's structure causes, taking into account the criteria specified in Section 7 of the guidelines. This includes receiving: a. information on major risk drivers; b. regular reports assessing the institution's overall structure and evaluating the compliance of individual entities' activities with the approved group-wide strategy; and c. regular reports on topics where the regulatory framework requires compliance at individual, sub-consolidated and consolidated levels. 31 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY",

As part of the establishment and maintenance of internal control, the Board shall regularly receive reports on the supervised entity's most significant risks and damage events. Guideline (paragraphs 27-30)\n\n(27) The FIN-FSA recommends that the information to be reported include, for example, descriptions of events, reasons for events, estimates of direct and indirect costs, and measures for damage prevention. It is also recommended that the measures taken in response to the damage and the contact persons and schedule for the corrective actions be reported.\n\n(28) The FIN-FSA recommends that the executive management of the supervised entity regularly assess the up-to-dateness, precision and appropriateness of the risk management procedures and reporting systems. The contents and level of detail of reports as well as their dissemination and reporting frequency should also be assessed on a regular basis.\n\n(29) Bearing in mind the significance of monitoring and reporting, the FIN-FSA recommends the setting of a threshold amount, above which the events should be reported. Even small damages and close calls should be reported, if they are fundamentally important to the functioning of the risk management.\n\n(30) The FIN-FSA recommends that the monitoring of losses due to operational risk be carried out according to the below table.

Where an institution creates many legal entities within its group, their number and, in particular, the interconnections and transactions between them should not pose challenges for the design of its internal governance, and for the effective management and oversight of the risks of the group as a whole . The management body should ensure that the structure of an institution and, where applicable, the structures within a group, taking into account the criteria specified in Section 7, are clear, efficient and transparent to the institution's staff, shareholders and other stakeholders and to the competent authority.\n\n73.

The management body of a consolidating institution should understand not only the legal, organisational and operational structure of the group but also the purpose and activities of its different entities and the links and relationships among them. This includes understanding group-specific operational risks and intra-group exposures as well as how the group's funding, capital, liquidity and risk profiles could be affected under normal and adverse circumstances. The management body should ensure that the institution is able to produce information on the group in a timely manner, regarding the type, the characteristics, the organisational chart, the ownership structure and the businesses of each legal entity, and that the institutions within the group comply with all supervisory reporting requirements on an individual, sub-consolidated and consolidated basis.\n\n75. The management body of a consolidating institution should ensure that the different group entities (including the consolidating institution itself) receive enough information to get a clear perception of the general objectives, strategies and risk profile of the group and how the group entity concerned is embedded in the group's structure and operational functioning. Such information and revisions thereof should be documented and made available to the relevant functions concerned, including the management body, business lines and internal control functions. The members of the management body of a consolidating institution should keep themselves informed about the risks the group's structure causes, taking into account the criteria specified in Section 7 of the guidelines. This includes receiving: a. information on major risk drivers; b. regular reports assessing the institution's overall structure and evaluating the compliance of individual entities' activities with the approved group-wide strategy; and c. regular reports on topics where the regulatory framework requires compliance at individual, sub-consolidated and consolidated levels. 31 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY",

Alternatively, they may be allowed to be dynamic, permitting, for example, a more forward-looking exploration of how institutions' business plans might evolve under the stress scenario or how credit volumes might evolve over time. For enhanced comparability, competent authorities may consider opting for the static balance sheet approach.

For the purposes of bottom-up supervisory stress tests, competent authorities should aim to assess the impact of such exercises consistently and fairly across the institutions covered by supervisory stress tests, respecting the level playing field. Competent authorities should also consider the extent to which stress test results reflect differences in modelling choices and judgements among institutions, rather than true differences in the risks to which they are exposed.\n\n633.

For the purpose of calibrating downturn LGD for each considered downturn period identified in accordance with Regulation (EU) xx/xx [RTS on economic downturn], institutions should use one of the three types of approaches set out in Section 5, Section 6 and Section 7 of these guidelines in accordance with the hierarchy set out in paragraphs 23 to 25 below.\n\n23. Where institutions have sufficient and relevant loss data to conduct the impact analysis set out in paragraph 27, they should calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period in accordance with Section 5 of these guidelines. For this purpose, institutions should ensure that the relevant loss data is available during the considered downturn period as well as during an appropriate period before and after the considered downturn period.\n\n24. Where sufficient and relevant loss data to assess the impact of the considered downturn period is not available but it is possible to calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period by applying the approach set out in Section 6, institutions should calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period in accordance with Section 6 of these guidelines.\n\n25. Where sufficient and relevant loss data to assess the impact of the considered downturn period is not available, and it is not possible to quantify downturn LGD for the considered downturn period by applying the approach set out in Section 6, institutions should calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period in accordance with Section 7 of these guidelines.\n\n26. Regardless of the approach used for calibrating downturn LGD institutions should adhere to the following principles (a) where the approach used involves the estimation or analysis of different intermediate parameters, the aggregation of these intermediate parameters for the purpose of calibrating downturn LGD should start with the parameter where the highest impact is observed in accordance with paragraph 27 or estimated in 45 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY accordance with paragraph 30 and any additional impact observed or estimated on other parameters should be added where necessary. (b) The downturn LGD estimates should not be biased by observed or estimated cash flows that are received with a significantly longer time lag than the period referred to in paragraph 156 of [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] and which might rather reflect an upturn or improved economic conditions following the considered downturn period.\n\n5. Downturn LGD estimation based on observed impact\n\n27. In order to calibrate downturn LGD based on the observed impact of a considered downturn period, institutions should carry out an analysis of the impact of this downturn period on the loss data related to the considered calibration segment. (a) The analysis shall comprise at a minimum all of the following: (i) evidence of elevated levels of realised LGDs, driven by the considered downturn period taking into account all of the following:\n\n(1) the realised LGDs should be calculated as averages related to all defaults that occurred in a considered year and that have either reached their maximum time of recovery in accordance with paragraph 156 [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] or have been closed before;\n\n(2) for all incomplete recovery processes of defaulted exposures that have not reached their maximum time of recovery in accordance with paragraph 156 [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation], the marginal recoveries reached in each year after default should be computed. The resulting recovery patterns should be compared to the recovery patterns of the defaults considered in letter (1) for each year in which the defaults occurred. (ii) evidence of decreased annual recoveries by sources of recoveries that are relevant for the considered calibration segment. These annual recoveries should be analysed with and without repossessions where applicable and irrespective of the date of default; (iii) evidence of decreased numbers of exposures that defaulted and returned back to the non-defaulted status within a predefined fixed horizons for all defaults that happened in a considered year in accordance with Article 178(5) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013; The predefined fixed horizon should be appropriate for the type of exposure under consideration. (iv) evidence of increased time in default per year related to all defaults in a considered year. 46 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY (b) The analysis required in paragraph 27(a) shall take into account as many points in time as possible where sufficient relevant loss data is available. Otherwise, if only scarce relevant loss data is available on an annual basis, institutions should merge consecutive years of observations as long as deemed of added value for the analysis. (c) The analysis required in paragraph 27(a) and (b), shall take into account any lag between a downturn period and the time when its potential impact is observed on the relevant loss data.\n\n28. Based on the evidence obtained from the impact analysis referred to in paragraph 27, institutions should calibrate downturn LGD by applying an estimation methodology which is coherent with the evidence obtained from the impact analysis.\n\n29. Where the impact analysis conducted in accordance with paragraph 27 shows no impact of a downturn period on an institution's relevant loss data, such that the average observed realised losses in this downturn period are not different from those under other economic conditions, the institution may use the long-run average LGD as downturn LGD, where all of the following applies: (a) the institution ensures and documents that the deficiencies identified and MoC applied in accordance with Section 4.4 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] incorporate all additional elements of uncertainty related to the identified downturn periods; (b) for the purpose of letter (a), the institution should in particular verify that, for the considered downturn period, none of the deficiencies identified under the Category A, MoC in accordance with paragraph 37(a) of [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] are of higher severity and that no additional deficiencies or adjustments under the Category B MoC in accordance with paragraph 37(b) of [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] are applicable.\n\n6. Downturn LGD estimation based on estimated impact\n\n30. Where paragraph 24 applies, institutions should calibrate downturn LGD using one of the methodologies specified in paragraph 31 ('haircut approach') and paragraph 32 ('extrapolation approach') or a combination of those. Prior to quantifying its downturn LGD estimates, institutions should choose the most relevant methodology based on: (a) the appropriateness of the methodology to estimate the impact of the downturn period under consideration on a realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers; (b) where relevant, the need to use a combination of the methodologies to ensure that the resulting downturn LGDs for the downturn period under consideration adequately reflect a potential downturn impact on all material components of 47 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY economic loss in accordance with Section 6.3.1 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] and in accordance with the principles set out in paragraph 26; In particular the haircut approach should be considered most appropriate for the above purposes where the market value or an according index related to a relevant type of collateral serves as a direct or transformed input into an institution's model for LGD estimation and has been identified as a relevant economic factor in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No xx/xxx [RTS on economic downturn].\n\n31. ('Haircut approach') For the purpose of these guidelines, a 'haircut approach' refers to an approach for the estimation of the impact of the downturn period on realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers in which one or several economic factors as referred to in Regulation (EU) xx/xx [RTS on economic downturn] are direct or transformed input(s) in the LGD model and where for the purpose of this estimation these input(s) are adjusted to reflect the impact of the downturn period under consideration. In particular, where the considered economic factor relates to the downturn period under consideration, the haircut should be based on the most severe observation of this economic factor in accordance with the specification of the severity of an economic downturn laid down in Article 3 of Regulation (EU) xx/xx [RTS on economic downturn].\n\n32. ('Extrapolation Approach') For the purposes of these guidelines, an 'extrapolation approach' refers to the estimation of the impact of the downturn period under consideration on LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers if all of the following conditions are met: (a) where a statistically significant dependency between the realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers, averaged over appropriate periods in time, and the economic factors selected in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation xx/xxx [RTS on economic downturn] which are relevant for the downturn period under consideration, can be established the resulting estimates are based on the extrapolated values of the average realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers to the period reflecting the impact of the downturn period; (b) where no statistically significant dependency as described in paragraph 32(a) can be established for an intermediate parameter or risk driver, institutions may estimate the impact of the downturn period under consideration on an intermediate parameter or risk driver based on observed data from a different period, where all of following three conditions are met: (i) at least those components of economic loss that explain the major share of the total economic loss should be estimated by either a haircut approach in accordance with paragraph 31 or an extrapolation approach in accordance with paragraph 32(a); (ii) the institution has observed data for the intermediate parameter or risk driver for a sufficient period of time which is at least as long as the period referred to in Article 181(1)(j) or Article 181(2), last subparagraph of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013; this period of time should include a period 48 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY where the economic factor(s) underlying the considered downturn period show values representing adverse economic conditions. (iii) the intermediate parameter or risk driver under consideration shows low volatility in the periods referred to in sub point (ii).\n\n33. Where institutions have observed data covering the downturn period and reflecting the impact of the respective downturn conditions under consideration on an intermediate parameter or risk driver they should use the observed data in combination with the Haircut or Extrapolation Approach to calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period in accordance with paragraph 30.\n\n34. Where institutions apply any of the approaches outlined in paragraphs 31 to 33 for the purpose of estimating intermediate parameters or risk drivers, they should ensure that the dependency structure between intermediate parameters or risk drivers is reflected appropriately in the aggregation of these intermediate parameters or risk drivers in accordance with paragraph 30.\n\n35. To reflect the lack of sufficient loss data, institutions should quantify a strictly positive Category A MoC in accordance with paragraph 37(a)(xi) of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] for all approaches in this section. In particular, institutions applying an extrapolation approach: (a) as referred to in paragraph 32(a), should quantify the Category A MoC by using an appropriate confidence interval to reflect the uncertainty related to the statistical model used to describe the dependency between the realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers and the relevant economic factors; (b) for an intermediate parameter or risk driver as referred to in paragraph 32(b), should quantify the Category A MoC taking into account the ratio of the value(s) of the economic factor(s) underlying the considered downturn period identified in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation xx/xxx [RTS on economic downturn] and value(s) of the relevant economic factor(s) observed in the periods referred to in paragraph 32(b)(ii);\n\n7. Downturn LGD estimation where observed or estimated impact is not available\n\n36. Where the relevant loss data to assess the impact of the downturn period under consideration is not available and it is also not possible to calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period in accordance with Section 6 of these guidelines, institutions 49 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY should quantify downturn LGD through any other approach subject to the following conditions: (a) they should ensure that the appropriate MoC required to be applied in accordance with Section 4.4.3 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] includes a Category A MoC that is strictly positive to account for the missing data; (b) they should ensure that the resulting downturn LGD estimates including the final MoC as set out in paragraph 45 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation], for the considered downturn period are higher or equal to the minimum between . the according long-run average LGDs plus an add-on of 15 percentage points and · 105%; Moreover, they should provide justification to the satisfaction of the competent authority that they cannot calibrate downturn LGD appropriate for the considered downturn period by applying any of the approaches set out in Section 5 and Section 6 of these guidelines.\n\n8. Reference Value\n\n37. Institutions should calculate a reference value in accordance with the following sequence of steps: (a) Using all available loss data, institutions should select the two individual years with the highest observed economic loss by: (i) grouping all defaults according to the year in which the defaults occurred; (ii) for each year as identified in (i) calculating for the defaults that occurred in the considered year the ratio of total economic loss as specified in Section 6.3.1 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] to the total outstanding amount of the according credit obligations at the moment of default; (iii) selecting the two individual years with the highest annual ratio of total economic loss to total outstanding amount resulting from (ii) as the two individual years with the highest observed economic losses. (b) Institutions should calculate the reference value(s) at least for each calibration segment as the simple average of the average realised LGDs from the two individual years with the highest observed economic losses, as identified in paragraph 37(a)(iii). 50 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY\n\n4.

For the purpose of calibrating downturn LGD for each considered downturn period identified in accordance with Regulation (EU) xx/xx [RTS on economic downturn], institutions should use one of the three types of approaches set out in Section 5, Section 6 and Section 7 of these guidelines in accordance with the hierarchy set out in paragraphs 23 to 25 below.\n\n23. Where institutions have sufficient and relevant loss data to conduct the impact analysis set out in paragraph 27, they should calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period in accordance with Section 5 of these guidelines. For this purpose, institutions should ensure that the relevant loss data is available during the considered downturn period as well as during an appropriate period before and after the considered downturn period.\n\n24. Where sufficient and relevant loss data to assess the impact of the considered downturn period is not available but it is possible to calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period by applying the approach set out in Section 6, institutions should calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period in accordance with Section 6 of these guidelines.\n\n25. Where sufficient and relevant loss data to assess the impact of the considered downturn period is not available, and it is not possible to quantify downturn LGD for the considered downturn period by applying the approach set out in Section 6, institutions should calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period in accordance with Section 7 of these guidelines.\n\n26. Regardless of the approach used for calibrating downturn LGD institutions should adhere to the following principles (a) where the approach used involves the estimation or analysis of different intermediate parameters, the aggregation of these intermediate parameters for the purpose of calibrating downturn LGD should start with the parameter where the highest impact is observed in accordance with paragraph 27 or estimated in 45 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY accordance with paragraph 30 and any additional impact observed or estimated on other parameters should be added where necessary. (b) The downturn LGD estimates should not be biased by observed or estimated cash flows that are received with a significantly longer time lag than the period referred to in paragraph 156 of [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] and which might rather reflect an upturn or improved economic conditions following the considered downturn period.\n\n5. Downturn LGD estimation based on observed impact\n\n27. In order to calibrate downturn LGD based on the observed impact of a considered downturn period, institutions should carry out an analysis of the impact of this downturn period on the loss data related to the considered calibration segment. (a) The analysis shall comprise at a minimum all of the following: (i) evidence of elevated levels of realised LGDs, driven by the considered downturn period taking into account all of the following:\n\n(1) the realised LGDs should be calculated as averages related to all defaults that occurred in a considered year and that have either reached their maximum time of recovery in accordance with paragraph 156 [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] or have been closed before;\n\n(2) for all incomplete recovery processes of defaulted exposures that have not reached their maximum time of recovery in accordance with paragraph 156 [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation], the marginal recoveries reached in each year after default should be computed. The resulting recovery patterns should be compared to the recovery patterns of the defaults considered in letter (1) for each year in which the defaults occurred. (ii) evidence of decreased annual recoveries by sources of recoveries that are relevant for the considered calibration segment. These annual recoveries should be analysed with and without repossessions where applicable and irrespective of the date of default; (iii) evidence of decreased numbers of exposures that defaulted and returned back to the non-defaulted status within a predefined fixed horizons for all defaults that happened in a considered year in accordance with Article 178(5) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013; The predefined fixed horizon should be appropriate for the type of exposure under consideration. (iv) evidence of increased time in default per year related to all defaults in a considered year. 46 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY (b) The analysis required in paragraph 27(a) shall take into account as many points in time as possible where sufficient relevant loss data is available. Otherwise, if only scarce relevant loss data is available on an annual basis, institutions should merge consecutive years of observations as long as deemed of added value for the analysis. (c) The analysis required in paragraph 27(a) and (b), shall take into account any lag between a downturn period and the time when its potential impact is observed on the relevant loss data.\n\n28. Based on the evidence obtained from the impact analysis referred to in paragraph 27, institutions should calibrate downturn LGD by applying an estimation methodology which is coherent with the evidence obtained from the impact analysis.\n\n29. Where the impact analysis conducted in accordance with paragraph 27 shows no impact of a downturn period on an institution's relevant loss data, such that the average observed realised losses in this downturn period are not different from those under other economic conditions, the institution may use the long-run average LGD as downturn LGD, where all of the following applies: (a) the institution ensures and documents that the deficiencies identified and MoC applied in accordance with Section 4.4 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] incorporate all additional elements of uncertainty related to the identified downturn periods; (b) for the purpose of letter (a), the institution should in particular verify that, for the considered downturn period, none of the deficiencies identified under the Category A, MoC in accordance with paragraph 37(a) of [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] are of higher severity and that no additional deficiencies or adjustments under the Category B MoC in accordance with paragraph 37(b) of [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] are applicable.\n\n6. Downturn LGD estimation based on estimated impact\n\n30. Where paragraph 24 applies, institutions should calibrate downturn LGD using one of the methodologies specified in paragraph 31 ('haircut approach') and paragraph 32 ('extrapolation approach') or a combination of those. Prior to quantifying its downturn LGD estimates, institutions should choose the most relevant methodology based on: (a) the appropriateness of the methodology to estimate the impact of the downturn period under consideration on a realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers; (b) where relevant, the need to use a combination of the methodologies to ensure that the resulting downturn LGDs for the downturn period under consideration adequately reflect a potential downturn impact on all material components of 47 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY economic loss in accordance with Section 6.3.1 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] and in accordance with the principles set out in paragraph 26; In particular the haircut approach should be considered most appropriate for the above purposes where the market value or an according index related to a relevant type of collateral serves as a direct or transformed input into an institution's model for LGD estimation and has been identified as a relevant economic factor in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No xx/xxx [RTS on economic downturn].\n\n31. ('Haircut approach') For the purpose of these guidelines, a 'haircut approach' refers to an approach for the estimation of the impact of the downturn period on realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers in which one or several economic factors as referred to in Regulation (EU) xx/xx [RTS on economic downturn] are direct or transformed input(s) in the LGD model and where for the purpose of this estimation these input(s) are adjusted to reflect the impact of the downturn period under consideration. In particular, where the considered economic factor relates to the downturn period under consideration, the haircut should be based on the most severe observation of this economic factor in accordance with the specification of the severity of an economic downturn laid down in Article 3 of Regulation (EU) xx/xx [RTS on economic downturn].\n\n32. ('Extrapolation Approach') For the purposes of these guidelines, an 'extrapolation approach' refers to the estimation of the impact of the downturn period under consideration on LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers if all of the following conditions are met: (a) where a statistically significant dependency between the realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers, averaged over appropriate periods in time, and the economic factors selected in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation xx/xxx [RTS on economic downturn] which are relevant for the downturn period under consideration, can be established the resulting estimates are based on the extrapolated values of the average realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers to the period reflecting the impact of the downturn period; (b) where no statistically significant dependency as described in paragraph 32(a) can be established for an intermediate parameter or risk driver, institutions may estimate the impact of the downturn period under consideration on an intermediate parameter or risk driver based on observed data from a different period, where all of following three conditions are met: (i) at least those components of economic loss that explain the major share of the total economic loss should be estimated by either a haircut approach in accordance with paragraph 31 or an extrapolation approach in accordance with paragraph 32(a); (ii) the institution has observed data for the intermediate parameter or risk driver for a sufficient period of time which is at least as long as the period referred to in Article 181(1)(j) or Article 181(2), last subparagraph of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013; this period of time should include a period 48 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY where the economic factor(s) underlying the considered downturn period show values representing adverse economic conditions. (iii) the intermediate parameter or risk driver under consideration shows low volatility in the periods referred to in sub point (ii).\n\n33. Where institutions have observed data covering the downturn period and reflecting the impact of the respective downturn conditions under consideration on an intermediate parameter or risk driver they should use the observed data in combination with the Haircut or Extrapolation Approach to calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period in accordance with paragraph 30.\n\n34. Where institutions apply any of the approaches outlined in paragraphs 31 to 33 for the purpose of estimating intermediate parameters or risk drivers, they should ensure that the dependency structure between intermediate parameters or risk drivers is reflected appropriately in the aggregation of these intermediate parameters or risk drivers in accordance with paragraph 30.\n\n35. To reflect the lack of sufficient loss data, institutions should quantify a strictly positive Category A MoC in accordance with paragraph 37(a)(xi) of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] for all approaches in this section. In particular, institutions applying an extrapolation approach: (a) as referred to in paragraph 32(a), should quantify the Category A MoC by using an appropriate confidence interval to reflect the uncertainty related to the statistical model used to describe the dependency between the realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers and the relevant economic factors; (b) for an intermediate parameter or risk driver as referred to in paragraph 32(b), should quantify the Category A MoC taking into account the ratio of the value(s) of the economic factor(s) underlying the considered downturn period identified in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation xx/xxx [RTS on economic downturn] and value(s) of the relevant economic factor(s) observed in the periods referred to in paragraph 32(b)(ii);\n\n7. Downturn LGD estimation where observed or estimated impact is not available\n\n36. Where the relevant loss data to assess the impact of the downturn period under consideration is not available and it is also not possible to calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period in accordance with Section 6 of these guidelines, institutions 49 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY should quantify downturn LGD through any other approach subject to the following conditions: (a) they should ensure that the appropriate MoC required to be applied in accordance with Section 4.4.3 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] includes a Category A MoC that is strictly positive to account for the missing data; (b) they should ensure that the resulting downturn LGD estimates including the final MoC as set out in paragraph 45 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation], for the considered downturn period are higher or equal to the minimum between . the according long-run average LGDs plus an add-on of 15 percentage points and · 105%; Moreover, they should provide justification to the satisfaction of the competent authority that they cannot calibrate downturn LGD appropriate for the considered downturn period by applying any of the approaches set out in Section 5 and Section 6 of these guidelines.\n\n8. Reference Value\n\n37. Institutions should calculate a reference value in accordance with the following sequence of steps: (a) Using all available loss data, institutions should select the two individual years with the highest observed economic loss by: (i) grouping all defaults according to the year in which the defaults occurred; (ii) for each year as identified in (i) calculating for the defaults that occurred in the considered year the ratio of total economic loss as specified in Section 6.3.1 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] to the total outstanding amount of the according credit obligations at the moment of default; (iii) selecting the two individual years with the highest annual ratio of total economic loss to total outstanding amount resulting from (ii) as the two individual years with the highest observed economic losses. (b) Institutions should calculate the reference value(s) at least for each calibration segment as the simple average of the average realised LGDs from the two individual years with the highest observed economic losses, as identified in paragraph 37(a)(iii). 50 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY\n\n4.

    "paragraph_b_text": "4.1: Do you agree with the proposed requirements with regard to the application of appropriate adjustments and margin of conservatism? Do you have any operational concerns with respect to the proposed categorisation? MoC general framework One respondent wondered whether the categories and examples included in the background and rationale section of the CP should be seen as a checklist of potential triggers of MoC, in the sense that the potential outcome for an institution may be a zero MoC for certain triggers. One respondent agreed that this should be the case, but another respondent argued that such a checklist would be strictly interpreted by supervisors as requiring an MoC for each individual category. This respondent disagreed with this annex. Due to the confusion about the nature of the list of triggers of MoC in the background and rationale section of the CP, the list has been removed from the final GL. Due to the specificities of triggers of MoC, it is deemed more appropriate to allow institutions to specify a list of all identified deficiencies along with the categories in which they are classified, without including in the GL an example of what such list of triggers might look like. Nevertheless, the GL do contain a non-exhaustive list of triggers of MoC, which institutions should analyse under the relevant categories. Institutions should also create for each rating system a complete list of Changes to the background and rationale section 123 GUIDELINES ON PD ESTIMATION, LGD ESTIMATION AND TREATMENT DEFAULTED EXPOSURES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received EBA analysis Amendments to the proposals references to final GL all identified deficiencies, including the categories in which these deficiencies are classified. Whereas several respondents welcomed the clarification of the MoC and adjustment framework set out in the GL, many raised concerns with respect to the practical feasibility of quantifying all MoCs for the individual categories. Some also mentioned that institutions currently already include adjustments and MoC in their estimations. Some respondents wondered whether the benefits of the proposed framework outweighed the costs. One bank argued that it would be operationally difficult to implement this framework by end-2020. One respondent argued that an MoC should only be applied as a last-resort measure, and that other ways to address a deficiency should be explored first. One respondent argued that the MoC framework introduced judgement and subjectivity, which comes at the expense of risk sensitivity. Based on this feedback, it has been decided to construct a different list of categories, which should facilitate the quantification of MoC by category, so that overlaps between triggers of MoC in different categories can be avoided. The new categories to be identified are the following: category A - MOC related to data and methodological deficiencies; category B - MoC related to relevant changes to underwriting standards, risk appetite, collection and recovery policies, and any other source of additional uncertainty; category C - general estimation error. The GL contain a non-exhaustive list of deficiencies that would fall into categories A and B. Changes to section 4.4 Some respondents opined that the scope of MoCs should be clarified, as should the methodologies that should be used (i.e. using confidence intervals or otherwise). Others mentioned that the GL should specify how the quantification should be performed. Although the EBA considered specifying how MoC should be quantified, it has been taken into account that a wide variety of practices exists, which corresponds to the different possible natures of the potential deficiencies and uncertainties. Therefore, the preferred approach, taken in the GL, is to specify a list of minimum conditions for the quantification of MoCs in each category, without prescribing a detailed methodology. As regards the clarification of the scope of MoC, it should be mentioned that an MoC should cover at least the expected range of Changes to section 4.4.3 124 GUIDELINES ON PD ESTIMATION, LGD ESTIMATION AND TREATMENT DEFAULTED EXPOSURES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received EBA analysis Amendments to the proposals references to final GL estimation errors, as required by Article 179(1)(f) and Article 180(1)(e) of the CRR. Since it would be impossible to anticipate all possible triggers of MoC, the GL contain a non-exhaustive list of potential deficiencies. Several respondents requested that the GL clarify that an MoC may be zero. It is specified in the GL that an MoC stemming from category C (general estimation error) should be greater than zero, whereas an MoC corresponding to category A or B should be greater than or equal to zero. Changes to paragraph 47 One respondent mentioned that the GL should clarify whether an adjustment may be negative, that an MoC may also be positive, and whether adjustments and MoC may or should be used together. Paragraph 26 of the CP on the GL already makes clear that the appropriate adjustment may be either positive or negative. This clarification has been retained in the final GL in paragraph 39. No change Some respondents requested clarification of the interaction between the use test and the MoC. Two respondents wonder whether it would still be possible to pass the use test after the implementation of the MoC framework under the GL. It was argued that institutions might typically want to use the model with the economic adjustment, and without the MoC, or with a lower MoC than the regulatory requirement, for their internal purposes. A new section 8.3. has been inserted in the final GL in order to clarify aspects related to the use test. The GL provide an exhaustive list of possible deviations from the parameters used for own funds requirements calculation that can be applied for internal purposes. However, the use of parameters in both obligatory and optional areas of the use test does not preclude taking into account information from other sources as well. The combination of the information on internal ratings or risk parameters and any other relevant information should lead to an appropriate management decision in accordance with the institution's policy. The requirements for the use test specified in these GL should be read New section 8.3 125 GUIDELINES ON PD ESTIMATION, LGD ESTIMATION AND TREATMENT DEFAULTED EXPOSURES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received EBA analysis Amendments to the proposals references to final GL together with the RTS on IRB assessment methodology, which in Articles 18 to 21 specify obligatory and optional areas of the use test. One respondent argued that the MoC framework proposed in the GL should be applied only to new model approvals and material model changes, and that it would be inappropriate to require retrospective application of the framework to existing models. Another respondent flagged this aspect as well, pointing out that the treatment of existing models is not clear from the GL. The EBA issued its Opinion on the implementation of the revision of the IRB Approach 14 in February 2016; the expected implementation timeline is specified in it based on previous consultations. In this opinion, it is established that the full review of internal models should be implemented by end-2020. The MoC framework is an integral part of PD and LGD estimation, and hence all internal models will have to comply with the final GL as well as the other aspects of the new regulatory framework by end- 2020. No change Identification of deficiencies Several respondents argued that the EBA should provide definitions for the categories and methodological aspects of MoC estimation. It was mentioned that the differences between categories A, B, C and D were not clear. It was also suggested that further standardisation of the criteria for the adjustments and MoC identification and quantification should be provided. For some respondents, it was mainly category C that was unclear. Some mentioned that, without this clarification, the MoC framework would lead to even less comparable estimates among banks. The EBA has further discussed the scope and definitions of the various categories. Based on the comments and difficulties associated with certain overlaps, it has been decided to redesign the categories and provide greater clarity where necessary. Note that paragraph 38 of the final GL contains a non-exhaustive list of potential deficiencies that should be analysed. Given the divergent nature of deficiencies and the multitude of possible methodologies that can be used to assess the appropriate adjustments and the MoC, it would not be beneficial to specify or limit methodologies for either the appropriate adjustments or the Changes to section 4.4",

For this purpose, institutions should ensure that the relevant loss data is available during the considered downturn period as well as during an appropriate period before and after the considered downturn period.\n\n24. Where sufficient and relevant loss data to assess the impact of the considered downturn period is not available but it is possible to calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period by applying the approach set out in Section 6, institutions should calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period in accordance with Section 6 of these guidelines.\n\n25. Where sufficient and relevant loss data to assess the impact of the considered downturn period is not available, and it is not possible to quantify downturn LGD for the considered downturn period by applying the approach set out in Section 6, institutions should calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period in accordance with Section 7 of these guidelines.\n\n26. Regardless of the approach used for calibrating downturn LGD institutions should adhere to the following principles (a) where the approach used involves the estimation or analysis of different intermediate parameters, the aggregation of these intermediate parameters for the purpose of calibrating downturn LGD should start with the parameter where the highest impact is observed in accordance with paragraph 27 or estimated in 45 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY accordance with paragraph 30 and any additional impact observed or estimated on other parameters should be added where necessary. (b) The downturn LGD estimates should not be biased by observed or estimated cash flows that are received with a significantly longer time lag than the period referred to in paragraph 156 of [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] and which might rather reflect an upturn or improved economic conditions following the considered downturn period.\n\n5. Downturn LGD estimation based on observed impact\n\n27. In order to calibrate downturn LGD based on the observed impact of a considered downturn period, institutions should carry out an analysis of the impact of this downturn period on the loss data related to the considered calibration segment. (a) The analysis shall comprise at a minimum all of the following: (i) evidence of elevated levels of realised LGDs, driven by the considered downturn period taking into account all of the following:\n\n(1) the realised LGDs should be calculated as averages related to all defaults that occurred in a considered year and that have either reached their maximum time of recovery in accordance with paragraph 156 [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] or have been closed before;\n\n(2) for all incomplete recovery processes of defaulted exposures that have not reached their maximum time of recovery in accordance with paragraph 156 [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation], the marginal recoveries reached in each year after default should be computed. The resulting recovery patterns should be compared to the recovery patterns of the defaults considered in letter (1) for each year in which the defaults occurred. (ii) evidence of decreased annual recoveries by sources of recoveries that are relevant for the considered calibration segment. These annual recoveries should be analysed with and without repossessions where applicable and irrespective of the date of default; (iii) evidence of decreased numbers of exposures that defaulted and returned back to the non-defaulted status within a predefined fixed horizons for all defaults that happened in a considered year in accordance with Article 178(5) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013; The predefined fixed horizon should be appropriate for the type of exposure under consideration. (iv) evidence of increased time in default per year related to all defaults in a considered year. 46 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY (b) The analysis required in paragraph 27(a) shall take into account as many points in time as possible where sufficient relevant loss data is available. Otherwise, if only scarce relevant loss data is available on an annual basis, institutions should merge consecutive years of observations as long as deemed of added value for the analysis. (c) The analysis required in paragraph 27(a) and (b), shall take into account any lag between a downturn period and the time when its potential impact is observed on the relevant loss data.\n\n28. Based on the evidence obtained from the impact analysis referred to in paragraph 27, institutions should calibrate downturn LGD by applying an estimation methodology which is coherent with the evidence obtained from the impact analysis.\n\n29. Where the impact analysis conducted in accordance with paragraph 27 shows no impact of a downturn period on an institution's relevant loss data, such that the average observed realised losses in this downturn period are not different from those under other economic conditions, the institution may use the long-run average LGD as downturn LGD, where all of the following applies: (a) the institution ensures and documents that the deficiencies identified and MoC applied in accordance with Section 4.4 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] incorporate all additional elements of uncertainty related to the identified downturn periods; (b) for the purpose of letter (a), the institution should in particular verify that, for the considered downturn period, none of the deficiencies identified under the Category A, MoC in accordance with paragraph 37(a) of [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] are of higher severity and that no additional deficiencies or adjustments under the Category B MoC in accordance with paragraph 37(b) of [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] are applicable.\n\n6. Downturn LGD estimation based on estimated impact\n\n30. Where paragraph 24 applies, institutions should calibrate downturn LGD using one of the methodologies specified in paragraph 31 ('haircut approach') and paragraph 32 ('extrapolation approach') or a combination of those. Prior to quantifying its downturn LGD estimates, institutions should choose the most relevant methodology based on: (a) the appropriateness of the methodology to estimate the impact of the downturn period under consideration on a realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers; (b) where relevant, the need to use a combination of the methodologies to ensure that the resulting downturn LGDs for the downturn period under consideration adequately reflect a potential downturn impact on all material components of 47 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY economic loss in accordance with Section 6.3.1 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] and in accordance with the principles set out in paragraph 26; In particular the haircut approach should be considered most appropriate for the above purposes where the market value or an according index related to a relevant type of collateral serves as a direct or transformed input into an institution's model for LGD estimation and has been identified as a relevant economic factor in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No xx/xxx [RTS on economic downturn].\n\n31. ('Haircut approach') For the purpose of these guidelines, a 'haircut approach' refers to an approach for the estimation of the impact of the downturn period on realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers in which one or several economic factors as referred to in Regulation (EU) xx/xx [RTS on economic downturn] are direct or transformed input(s) in the LGD model and where for the purpose of this estimation these input(s) are adjusted to reflect the impact of the downturn period under consideration. In particular, where the considered economic factor relates to the downturn period under consideration, the haircut should be based on the most severe observation of this economic factor in accordance with the specification of the severity of an economic downturn laid down in Article 3 of Regulation (EU) xx/xx [RTS on economic downturn].\n\n32. ('Extrapolation Approach') For the purposes of these guidelines, an 'extrapolation approach' refers to the estimation of the impact of the downturn period under consideration on LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers if all of the following conditions are met: (a) where a statistically significant dependency between the realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers, averaged over appropriate periods in time, and the economic factors selected in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation xx/xxx [RTS on economic downturn] which are relevant for the downturn period under consideration, can be established the resulting estimates are based on the extrapolated values of the average realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers to the period reflecting the impact of the downturn period; (b) where no statistically significant dependency as described in paragraph 32(a) can be established for an intermediate parameter or risk driver, institutions may estimate the impact of the downturn period under consideration on an intermediate parameter or risk driver based on observed data from a different period, where all of following three conditions are met: (i) at least those components of economic loss that explain the major share of the total economic loss should be estimated by either a haircut approach in accordance with paragraph 31 or an extrapolation approach in accordance with paragraph 32(a); (ii) the institution has observed data for the intermediate parameter or risk driver for a sufficient period of time which is at least as long as the period referred to in Article 181(1)(j) or Article 181(2), last subparagraph of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013; this period of time should include a period 48 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY where the economic factor(s) underlying the considered downturn period show values representing adverse economic conditions. (iii) the intermediate parameter or risk driver under consideration shows low volatility in the periods referred to in sub point (ii).\n\n33. Where institutions have observed data covering the downturn period and reflecting the impact of the respective downturn conditions under consideration on an intermediate parameter or risk driver they should use the observed data in combination with the Haircut or Extrapolation Approach to calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period in accordance with paragraph 30.\n\n34. Where institutions apply any of the approaches outlined in paragraphs 31 to 33 for the purpose of estimating intermediate parameters or risk drivers, they should ensure that the dependency structure between intermediate parameters or risk drivers is reflected appropriately in the aggregation of these intermediate parameters or risk drivers in accordance with paragraph 30.\n\n35. To reflect the lack of sufficient loss data, institutions should quantify a strictly positive Category A MoC in accordance with paragraph 37(a)(xi) of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] for all approaches in this section. In particular, institutions applying an extrapolation approach: (a) as referred to in paragraph 32(a), should quantify the Category A MoC by using an appropriate confidence interval to reflect the uncertainty related to the statistical model used to describe the dependency between the realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers and the relevant economic factors; (b) for an intermediate parameter or risk driver as referred to in paragraph 32(b), should quantify the Category A MoC taking into account the ratio of the value(s) of the economic factor(s) underlying the considered downturn period identified in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation xx/xxx [RTS on economic downturn] and value(s) of the relevant economic factor(s) observed in the periods referred to in paragraph 32(b)(ii);\n\n7. Downturn LGD estimation where observed or estimated impact is not available\n\n36. Where the relevant loss data to assess the impact of the downturn period under consideration is not available and it is also not possible to calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period in accordance with Section 6 of these guidelines, institutions 49 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY should quantify downturn LGD through any other approach subject to the following conditions: (a) they should ensure that the appropriate MoC required to be applied in accordance with Section 4.4.3 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] includes a Category A MoC that is strictly positive to account for the missing data; (b) they should ensure that the resulting downturn LGD estimates including the final MoC as set out in paragraph 45 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation], for the considered downturn period are higher or equal to the minimum between . the according long-run average LGDs plus an add-on of 15 percentage points and · 105%; Moreover, they should provide justification to the satisfaction of the competent authority that they cannot calibrate downturn LGD appropriate for the considered downturn period by applying any of the approaches set out in Section 5 and Section 6 of these guidelines.\n\n8. Reference Value\n\n37. Institutions should calculate a reference value in accordance with the following sequence of steps: (a) Using all available loss data, institutions should select the two individual years with the highest observed economic loss by: (i) grouping all defaults according to the year in which the defaults occurred; (ii) for each year as identified in (i) calculating for the defaults that occurred in the considered year the ratio of total economic loss as specified in Section 6.3.1 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] to the total outstanding amount of the according credit obligations at the moment of default; (iii) selecting the two individual years with the highest annual ratio of total economic loss to total outstanding amount resulting from (ii) as the two individual years with the highest observed economic losses. (b) Institutions should calculate the reference value(s) at least for each calibration segment as the simple average of the average realised LGDs from the two individual years with the highest observed economic losses, as identified in paragraph 37(a)(iii). 50 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY\n\n4.

Institutions should be aware that relevant risk parameters related to operational risk may derive from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, including legal risks, or from external events, and may affect all products and activities within the institution.\n\n133. . In order to stress relevant risk parameters, institutions should use the profit and loss (P&L) effect of operational losses as the main metric. Any intrinsic impact caused by the operational risk event should be considered as an operational risk loss (e.g. intrinsic impacts from opportunity costs, or internal costs such as overtime/bonuses, etc., where they relate to an operational risk event). In addition, and only for the purpose of stress testing, any loss of future earnings caused by operational risk events (excluding second-line effects on the macroeconomic environment) should be included. At least the institutions under the advanced measurement approach (AMA) should also take these losses into account as they flow into the internal loss database to calculate the additional capital requirements. When using historical data, external data or scenarios as inputs for both P&L and RWA projections, institutions should take into account and avoid possible double-counting effects on the input side. 38 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INSTITUTIONS' STRESS TESTING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY\n\n134. As operational losses may induce second-round effects (i.e. reputational risk), in order to account for such effects, the operational risk stress testing programme should be thoroughly integrated into the institution-wide stress test and should include interconnections with liquidity and own funds requirements. Institutions should analyse at least: a) the exposure of the institution to activities and its associated risk culture and past record of operational losses, with a focus on the level and change in losses and gross income in the past few years; b) the business environment, including geographical locations, in which the institution operates and macroeconomic conditions; c) the evolution in headcount and in balance-sheet size and complexity over the past few years, including structural changes due to corporate events such as mergers and acquisitions; d) changes to significant elements of the information technology infrastructure; e) the degree and orientation of incentivising in compensation schemes; f) the complexity of processes and procedures, products and information technology systems; g) the extent of outsourcing, with regard to the concentration risk associated with all outsourcing arrangements and external market infrastructures; and h) the vulnerability of modelling risk, especially in areas related to the trading of financial instruments, risk measurement and management, and capital allocation.\n\n135. Idiosyncratic risk factors should also be explored and used as inputs for scenario design. Indicatively, institutions under the AMA should stress their business environment and internal control factors (BEICFs).\n\n136. Institutions should consider the interactions of, and individual exposures to, such idiosyncratic risk factors in determining their operational risk exposure.\n\n137. Institutions should analyse carefully the possible interaction of operational risk losses with credit and market risks.\n\n138. The analysis of the stress test events should involve expert judgement, to include at least low-frequency high-severity events.\n\n139. Institutions should design severe but plausible stress events. Assumptions may differ from assumptions used in credit and market risk stress scenarios. When an institution expands its business in the local or in the international markets through mergers and acquisitions, the design of new products or a new business line, the severe but plausible stress test scenarios should be based on expert judgement to overcome the possible lack of historical information.\n\n140. Institutions should build their stress testing programme based on both internal and external data, while analysing carefully: 39 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INSTITUTIONS' STRESS TESTING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY a) the use of scaling factors (e.g. in a situation where external data were scaled down, the scaling may be reduced) and the possible need for additional impacts stemming from changing scaling factors in a stress situation; and b) the criteria for determining the relevance of data (e.g. data on a large loss considered not relevant may be used within the stress test, in addition to Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) requirements).",

For the purpose of calibrating downturn LGD for each considered downturn period identified in accordance with Regulation (EU) xx/xx [RTS on economic downturn], institutions should use one of the three types of approaches set out in Section 5, Section 6 and Section 7 of these guidelines in accordance with the hierarchy set out in paragraphs 23 to 25 below.\n\n23. Where institutions have sufficient and relevant loss data to conduct the impact analysis set out in paragraph 27, they should calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period in accordance with Section 5 of these guidelines. For this purpose, institutions should ensure that the relevant loss data is available during the considered downturn period as well as during an appropriate period before and after the considered downturn period.\n\n24. Where sufficient and relevant loss data to assess the impact of the considered downturn period is not available but it is possible to calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period by applying the approach set out in Section 6, institutions should calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period in accordance with Section 6 of these guidelines.\n\n25. Where sufficient and relevant loss data to assess the impact of the considered downturn period is not available, and it is not possible to quantify downturn LGD for the considered downturn period by applying the approach set out in Section 6, institutions should calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period in accordance with Section 7 of these guidelines.\n\n26. Regardless of the approach used for calibrating downturn LGD institutions should adhere to the following principles (a) where the approach used involves the estimation or analysis of different intermediate parameters, the aggregation of these intermediate parameters for the purpose of calibrating downturn LGD should start with the parameter where the highest impact is observed in accordance with paragraph 27 or estimated in 45 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY accordance with paragraph 30 and any additional impact observed or estimated on other parameters should be added where necessary. (b) The downturn LGD estimates should not be biased by observed or estimated cash flows that are received with a significantly longer time lag than the period referred to in paragraph 156 of [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] and which might rather reflect an upturn or improved economic conditions following the considered downturn period.\n\n5. Downturn LGD estimation based on observed impact\n\n27. In order to calibrate downturn LGD based on the observed impact of a considered downturn period, institutions should carry out an analysis of the impact of this downturn period on the loss data related to the considered calibration segment. (a) The analysis shall comprise at a minimum all of the following: (i) evidence of elevated levels of realised LGDs, driven by the considered downturn period taking into account all of the following:\n\n(1) the realised LGDs should be calculated as averages related to all defaults that occurred in a considered year and that have either reached their maximum time of recovery in accordance with paragraph 156 [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] or have been closed before;\n\n(2) for all incomplete recovery processes of defaulted exposures that have not reached their maximum time of recovery in accordance with paragraph 156 [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation], the marginal recoveries reached in each year after default should be computed. The resulting recovery patterns should be compared to the recovery patterns of the defaults considered in letter (1) for each year in which the defaults occurred. (ii) evidence of decreased annual recoveries by sources of recoveries that are relevant for the considered calibration segment. These annual recoveries should be analysed with and without repossessions where applicable and irrespective of the date of default; (iii) evidence of decreased numbers of exposures that defaulted and returned back to the non-defaulted status within a predefined fixed horizons for all defaults that happened in a considered year in accordance with Article 178(5) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013; The predefined fixed horizon should be appropriate for the type of exposure under consideration. (iv) evidence of increased time in default per year related to all defaults in a considered year. 46 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY (b) The analysis required in paragraph 27(a) shall take into account as many points in time as possible where sufficient relevant loss data is available. Otherwise, if only scarce relevant loss data is available on an annual basis, institutions should merge consecutive years of observations as long as deemed of added value for the analysis. (c) The analysis required in paragraph 27(a) and (b), shall take into account any lag between a downturn period and the time when its potential impact is observed on the relevant loss data.\n\n28. Based on the evidence obtained from the impact analysis referred to in paragraph 27, institutions should calibrate downturn LGD by applying an estimation methodology which is coherent with the evidence obtained from the impact analysis.\n\n29. Where the impact analysis conducted in accordance with paragraph 27 shows no impact of a downturn period on an institution's relevant loss data, such that the average observed realised losses in this downturn period are not different from those under other economic conditions, the institution may use the long-run average LGD as downturn LGD, where all of the following applies: (a) the institution ensures and documents that the deficiencies identified and MoC applied in accordance with Section 4.4 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] incorporate all additional elements of uncertainty related to the identified downturn periods; (b) for the purpose of letter (a), the institution should in particular verify that, for the considered downturn period, none of the deficiencies identified under the Category A, MoC in accordance with paragraph 37(a) of [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] are of higher severity and that no additional deficiencies or adjustments under the Category B MoC in accordance with paragraph 37(b) of [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] are applicable.\n\n6. Downturn LGD estimation based on estimated impact\n\n30. Where paragraph 24 applies, institutions should calibrate downturn LGD using one of the methodologies specified in paragraph 31 ('haircut approach') and paragraph 32 ('extrapolation approach') or a combination of those. Prior to quantifying its downturn LGD estimates, institutions should choose the most relevant methodology based on: (a) the appropriateness of the methodology to estimate the impact of the downturn period under consideration on a realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers; (b) where relevant, the need to use a combination of the methodologies to ensure that the resulting downturn LGDs for the downturn period under consideration adequately reflect a potential downturn impact on all material components of 47 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY economic loss in accordance with Section 6.3.1 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] and in accordance with the principles set out in paragraph 26; In particular the haircut approach should be considered most appropriate for the above purposes where the market value or an according index related to a relevant type of collateral serves as a direct or transformed input into an institution's model for LGD estimation and has been identified as a relevant economic factor in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No xx/xxx [RTS on economic downturn].\n\n31. ('Haircut approach') For the purpose of these guidelines, a 'haircut approach' refers to an approach for the estimation of the impact of the downturn period on realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers in which one or several economic factors as referred to in Regulation (EU) xx/xx [RTS on economic downturn] are direct or transformed input(s) in the LGD model and where for the purpose of this estimation these input(s) are adjusted to reflect the impact of the downturn period under consideration. In particular, where the considered economic factor relates to the downturn period under consideration, the haircut should be based on the most severe observation of this economic factor in accordance with the specification of the severity of an economic downturn laid down in Article 3 of Regulation (EU) xx/xx [RTS on economic downturn].\n\n32. ('Extrapolation Approach') For the purposes of these guidelines, an 'extrapolation approach' refers to the estimation of the impact of the downturn period under consideration on LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers if all of the following conditions are met: (a) where a statistically significant dependency between the realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers, averaged over appropriate periods in time, and the economic factors selected in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation xx/xxx [RTS on economic downturn] which are relevant for the downturn period under consideration, can be established the resulting estimates are based on the extrapolated values of the average realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers to the period reflecting the impact of the downturn period; (b) where no statistically significant dependency as described in paragraph 32(a) can be established for an intermediate parameter or risk driver, institutions may estimate the impact of the downturn period under consideration on an intermediate parameter or risk driver based on observed data from a different period, where all of following three conditions are met: (i) at least those components of economic loss that explain the major share of the total economic loss should be estimated by either a haircut approach in accordance with paragraph 31 or an extrapolation approach in accordance with paragraph 32(a); (ii) the institution has observed data for the intermediate parameter or risk driver for a sufficient period of time which is at least as long as the period referred to in Article 181(1)(j) or Article 181(2), last subparagraph of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013; this period of time should include a period 48 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY where the economic factor(s) underlying the considered downturn period show values representing adverse economic conditions. (iii) the intermediate parameter or risk driver under consideration shows low volatility in the periods referred to in sub point (ii).\n\n33. Where institutions have observed data covering the downturn period and reflecting the impact of the respective downturn conditions under consideration on an intermediate parameter or risk driver they should use the observed data in combination with the Haircut or Extrapolation Approach to calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period in accordance with paragraph 30.\n\n34. Where institutions apply any of the approaches outlined in paragraphs 31 to 33 for the purpose of estimating intermediate parameters or risk drivers, they should ensure that the dependency structure between intermediate parameters or risk drivers is reflected appropriately in the aggregation of these intermediate parameters or risk drivers in accordance with paragraph 30.\n\n35. To reflect the lack of sufficient loss data, institutions should quantify a strictly positive Category A MoC in accordance with paragraph 37(a)(xi) of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] for all approaches in this section. In particular, institutions applying an extrapolation approach: (a) as referred to in paragraph 32(a), should quantify the Category A MoC by using an appropriate confidence interval to reflect the uncertainty related to the statistical model used to describe the dependency between the realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers and the relevant economic factors; (b) for an intermediate parameter or risk driver as referred to in paragraph 32(b), should quantify the Category A MoC taking into account the ratio of the value(s) of the economic factor(s) underlying the considered downturn period identified in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation xx/xxx [RTS on economic downturn] and value(s) of the relevant economic factor(s) observed in the periods referred to in paragraph 32(b)(ii);\n\n7. Downturn LGD estimation where observed or estimated impact is not available\n\n36. Where the relevant loss data to assess the impact of the downturn period under consideration is not available and it is also not possible to calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period in accordance with Section 6 of these guidelines, institutions 49 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY should quantify downturn LGD through any other approach subject to the following conditions: (a) they should ensure that the appropriate MoC required to be applied in accordance with Section 4.4.3 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] includes a Category A MoC that is strictly positive to account for the missing data; (b) they should ensure that the resulting downturn LGD estimates including the final MoC as set out in paragraph 45 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation], for the considered downturn period are higher or equal to the minimum between . the according long-run average LGDs plus an add-on of 15 percentage points and · 105%; Moreover, they should provide justification to the satisfaction of the competent authority that they cannot calibrate downturn LGD appropriate for the considered downturn period by applying any of the approaches set out in Section 5 and Section 6 of these guidelines.\n\n8. Reference Value\n\n37. Institutions should calculate a reference value in accordance with the following sequence of steps: (a) Using all available loss data, institutions should select the two individual years with the highest observed economic loss by: (i) grouping all defaults according to the year in which the defaults occurred; (ii) for each year as identified in (i) calculating for the defaults that occurred in the considered year the ratio of total economic loss as specified in Section 6.3.1 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] to the total outstanding amount of the according credit obligations at the moment of default; (iii) selecting the two individual years with the highest annual ratio of total economic loss to total outstanding amount resulting from (ii) as the two individual years with the highest observed economic losses. (b) Institutions should calculate the reference value(s) at least for each calibration segment as the simple average of the average realised LGDs from the two individual years with the highest observed economic losses, as identified in paragraph 37(a)(iii). 50 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY\n\n4.

(iv) evidence of increased time in default per year related to all defaults in a considered year. 46 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY (b) The analysis required in paragraph 27(a) shall take into account as many points in time as possible where sufficient relevant loss data is available. Otherwise, if only scarce relevant loss data is available on an annual basis, institutions should merge consecutive years of observations as long as deemed of added value for the analysis. (c) The analysis required in paragraph 27(a) and (b), shall take into account any lag between a downturn period and the time when its potential impact is observed on the relevant loss data.\n\n28. Based on the evidence obtained from the impact analysis referred to in paragraph 27, institutions should calibrate downturn LGD by applying an estimation methodology which is coherent with the evidence obtained from the impact analysis.\n\n29. Where the impact analysis conducted in accordance with paragraph 27 shows no impact of a downturn period on an institution's relevant loss data, such that the average observed realised losses in this downturn period are not different from those under other economic conditions, the institution may use the long-run average LGD as downturn LGD, where all of the following applies: (a) the institution ensures and documents that the deficiencies identified and MoC applied in accordance with Section 4.4 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] incorporate all additional elements of uncertainty related to the identified downturn periods; (b) for the purpose of letter (a), the institution should in particular verify that, for the considered downturn period, none of the deficiencies identified under the Category A, MoC in accordance with paragraph 37(a) of [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] are of higher severity and that no additional deficiencies or adjustments under the Category B MoC in accordance with paragraph 37(b) of [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] are applicable.\n\n6. Downturn LGD estimation based on estimated impact\n\n30. Where paragraph 24 applies, institutions should calibrate downturn LGD using one of the methodologies specified in paragraph 31 ('haircut approach') and paragraph 32 ('extrapolation approach') or a combination of those. Prior to quantifying its downturn LGD estimates, institutions should choose the most relevant methodology based on: (a) the appropriateness of the methodology to estimate the impact of the downturn period under consideration on a realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers; (b) where relevant, the need to use a combination of the methodologies to ensure that the resulting downturn LGDs for the downturn period under consideration adequately reflect a potential downturn impact on all material components of 47 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY economic loss in accordance with Section 6.3.1 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] and in accordance with the principles set out in paragraph 26; In particular the haircut approach should be considered most appropriate for the above purposes where the market value or an according index related to a relevant type of collateral serves as a direct or transformed input into an institution's model for LGD estimation and has been identified as a relevant economic factor in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No xx/xxx [RTS on economic downturn].\n\n31. ('Haircut approach') For the purpose of these guidelines, a 'haircut approach' refers to an approach for the estimation of the impact of the downturn period on realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers in which one or several economic factors as referred to in Regulation (EU) xx/xx [RTS on economic downturn] are direct or transformed input(s) in the LGD model and where for the purpose of this estimation these input(s) are adjusted to reflect the impact of the downturn period under consideration. In particular, where the considered economic factor relates to the downturn period under consideration, the haircut should be based on the most severe observation of this economic factor in accordance with the specification of the severity of an economic downturn laid down in Article 3 of Regulation (EU) xx/xx [RTS on economic downturn].\n\n32. ('Extrapolation Approach') For the purposes of these guidelines, an 'extrapolation approach' refers to the estimation of the impact of the downturn period under consideration on LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers if all of the following conditions are met: (a) where a statistically significant dependency between the realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers, averaged over appropriate periods in time, and the economic factors selected in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation xx/xxx [RTS on economic downturn] which are relevant for the downturn period under consideration, can be established the resulting estimates are based on the extrapolated values of the average realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers to the period reflecting the impact of the downturn period; (b) where no statistically significant dependency as described in paragraph 32(a) can be established for an intermediate parameter or risk driver, institutions may estimate the impact of the downturn period under consideration on an intermediate parameter or risk driver based on observed data from a different period, where all of following three conditions are met: (i) at least those components of economic loss that explain the major share of the total economic loss should be estimated by either a haircut approach in accordance with paragraph 31 or an extrapolation approach in accordance with paragraph 32(a); (ii) the institution has observed data for the intermediate parameter or risk driver for a sufficient period of time which is at least as long as the period referred to in Article 181(1)(j) or Article 181(2), last subparagraph of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013; this period of time should include a period 48 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY where the economic factor(s) underlying the considered downturn period show values representing adverse economic conditions. (iii) the intermediate parameter or risk driver under consideration shows low volatility in the periods referred to in sub point (ii).\n\n33. Where institutions have observed data covering the downturn period and reflecting the impact of the respective downturn conditions under consideration on an intermediate parameter or risk driver they should use the observed data in combination with the Haircut or Extrapolation Approach to calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period in accordance with paragraph 30.\n\n34. Where institutions apply any of the approaches outlined in paragraphs 31 to 33 for the purpose of estimating intermediate parameters or risk drivers, they should ensure that the dependency structure between intermediate parameters or risk drivers is reflected appropriately in the aggregation of these intermediate parameters or risk drivers in accordance with paragraph 30.\n\n35. To reflect the lack of sufficient loss data, institutions should quantify a strictly positive Category A MoC in accordance with paragraph 37(a)(xi) of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] for all approaches in this section. In particular, institutions applying an extrapolation approach: (a) as referred to in paragraph 32(a), should quantify the Category A MoC by using an appropriate confidence interval to reflect the uncertainty related to the statistical model used to describe the dependency between the realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers and the relevant economic factors; (b) for an intermediate parameter or risk driver as referred to in paragraph 32(b), should quantify the Category A MoC taking into account the ratio of the value(s) of the economic factor(s) underlying the considered downturn period identified in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation xx/xxx [RTS on economic downturn] and value(s) of the relevant economic factor(s) observed in the periods referred to in paragraph 32(b)(ii);\n\n7. Downturn LGD estimation where observed or estimated impact is not available\n\n36. Where the relevant loss data to assess the impact of the downturn period under consideration is not available and it is also not possible to calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period in accordance with Section 6 of these guidelines, institutions 49 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY should quantify downturn LGD through any other approach subject to the following conditions: (a) they should ensure that the appropriate MoC required to be applied in accordance with Section 4.4.3 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] includes a Category A MoC that is strictly positive to account for the missing data; (b) they should ensure that the resulting downturn LGD estimates including the final MoC as set out in paragraph 45 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation], for the considered downturn period are higher or equal to the minimum between . the according long-run average LGDs plus an add-on of 15 percentage points and · 105%; Moreover, they should provide justification to the satisfaction of the competent authority that they cannot calibrate downturn LGD appropriate for the considered downturn period by applying any of the approaches set out in Section 5 and Section 6 of these guidelines.\n\n8. Reference Value\n\n37. Institutions should calculate a reference value in accordance with the following sequence of steps: (a) Using all available loss data, institutions should select the two individual years with the highest observed economic loss by: (i) grouping all defaults according to the year in which the defaults occurred; (ii) for each year as identified in (i) calculating for the defaults that occurred in the considered year the ratio of total economic loss as specified in Section 6.3.1 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] to the total outstanding amount of the according credit obligations at the moment of default; (iii) selecting the two individual years with the highest annual ratio of total economic loss to total outstanding amount resulting from (ii) as the two individual years with the highest observed economic losses. (b) Institutions should calculate the reference value(s) at least for each calibration segment as the simple average of the average realised LGDs from the two individual years with the highest observed economic losses, as identified in paragraph 37(a)(iii). 50 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY\n\n4.

In addition, the risks associated with emergency conditions are generally more serious than those prepared for in continuity plans.\n\n(21) The guidelines for contingency planning included here may also be applied to severe disruptions and crises other than the emergency conditions referred to in the Emergency Powers Act. Serious disruptions and crises may, for example, be caused by serious threats to functioning of staff or destruction of a supervised entity's premises or IT environment.\n\n(22) In its decision of 5 December 2013, the Government set general objectives for maintenance readiness.

This type of key data includes at least basic data on customers and customer contracts, for example personal data, and data on customers' asset and liability positions. Recovery of data from separate security backup to generally readable electronic format should be tested.\n\n(28) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities' contingency planning also cover outsourced activities in as far as core functions and services must be maintained during emergency conditions. Contingency planning requirements should be taken into account already when outsourcing contracts are drawn up. Supervised entities subject to contingency planning requirements should evaluate contingency plans drawn up by external suppliers and ensure that they meet prevailing requirements. A supervised entity subject to contingency planning requirements should, for example, test an external supplier's contingency plan in joint trial runs with the supplier.\n\n(29) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities subject to contingency planning requirements ensure that they have adequate resources and capacity to maintain their activities in emergency situations and during severe disruptions. Plans for accessing substitute staff and premises should also be made in advance. Availability of substitute resources should be ensured in advance for situations in which a large part of the supervised entity's staff is absent or part of the entity's main premises, hardware and software have been destroyed, or is not otherwise available, or the entity is prevented from carrying out business over a large geographic area.\n\n(30) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities subject to contingency planning requirements should continue their reporting to the authorities also in emergency conditions.",

For the purpose of calibrating downturn LGD for each considered downturn period identified in accordance with Regulation (EU) xx/xx [RTS on economic downturn], institutions should use one of the three types of approaches set out in Section 5, Section 6 and Section 7 of these guidelines in accordance with the hierarchy set out in paragraphs 23 to 25 below.\n\n23. Where institutions have sufficient and relevant loss data to conduct the impact analysis set out in paragraph 27, they should calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period in accordance with Section 5 of these guidelines. For this purpose, institutions should ensure that the relevant loss data is available during the considered downturn period as well as during an appropriate period before and after the considered downturn period.\n\n24. Where sufficient and relevant loss data to assess the impact of the considered downturn period is not available but it is possible to calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period by applying the approach set out in Section 6, institutions should calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period in accordance with Section 6 of these guidelines.\n\n25. Where sufficient and relevant loss data to assess the impact of the considered downturn period is not available, and it is not possible to quantify downturn LGD for the considered downturn period by applying the approach set out in Section 6, institutions should calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period in accordance with Section 7 of these guidelines.\n\n26. Regardless of the approach used for calibrating downturn LGD institutions should adhere to the following principles (a) where the approach used involves the estimation or analysis of different intermediate parameters, the aggregation of these intermediate parameters for the purpose of calibrating downturn LGD should start with the parameter where the highest impact is observed in accordance with paragraph 27 or estimated in 45 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY accordance with paragraph 30 and any additional impact observed or estimated on other parameters should be added where necessary. (b) The downturn LGD estimates should not be biased by observed or estimated cash flows that are received with a significantly longer time lag than the period referred to in paragraph 156 of [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] and which might rather reflect an upturn or improved economic conditions following the considered downturn period.\n\n5. Downturn LGD estimation based on observed impact\n\n27. In order to calibrate downturn LGD based on the observed impact of a considered downturn period, institutions should carry out an analysis of the impact of this downturn period on the loss data related to the considered calibration segment. (a) The analysis shall comprise at a minimum all of the following: (i) evidence of elevated levels of realised LGDs, driven by the considered downturn period taking into account all of the following:\n\n(1) the realised LGDs should be calculated as averages related to all defaults that occurred in a considered year and that have either reached their maximum time of recovery in accordance with paragraph 156 [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] or have been closed before;\n\n(2) for all incomplete recovery processes of defaulted exposures that have not reached their maximum time of recovery in accordance with paragraph 156 [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation], the marginal recoveries reached in each year after default should be computed. The resulting recovery patterns should be compared to the recovery patterns of the defaults considered in letter (1) for each year in which the defaults occurred.

Where the impact analysis conducted in accordance with paragraph 27 shows no impact of a downturn period on an institution's relevant loss data, such that the average observed realised losses in this downturn period are not different from those under other economic conditions, the institution may use the long-run average LGD as downturn LGD, where all of the following applies: (a) the institution ensures and documents that the deficiencies identified and MoC applied in accordance with Section 4.4 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] incorporate all additional elements of uncertainty related to the identified downturn periods; (b) for the purpose of letter (a), the institution should in particular verify that, for the considered downturn period, none of the deficiencies identified under the Category A, MoC in accordance with paragraph 37(a) of [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] are of higher severity and that no additional deficiencies or adjustments under the Category B MoC in accordance with paragraph 37(b) of [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] are applicable.\n\n6. Downturn LGD estimation based on estimated impact\n\n30. Where paragraph 24 applies, institutions should calibrate downturn LGD using one of the methodologies specified in paragraph 31 ('haircut approach') and paragraph 32 ('extrapolation approach') or a combination of those. Prior to quantifying its downturn LGD estimates, institutions should choose the most relevant methodology based on: (a) the appropriateness of the methodology to estimate the impact of the downturn period under consideration on a realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers; (b) where relevant, the need to use a combination of the methodologies to ensure that the resulting downturn LGDs for the downturn period under consideration adequately reflect a potential downturn impact on all material components of 47 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY economic loss in accordance with Section 6.3.1 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] and in accordance with the principles set out in paragraph 26; In particular the haircut approach should be considered most appropriate for the above purposes where the market value or an according index related to a relevant type of collateral serves as a direct or transformed input into an institution's model for LGD estimation and has been identified as a relevant economic factor in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No xx/xxx [RTS on economic downturn].\n\n31. ('Haircut approach') For the purpose of these guidelines, a 'haircut approach' refers to an approach for the estimation of the impact of the downturn period on realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers in which one or several economic factors as referred to in Regulation (EU) xx/xx [RTS on economic downturn] are direct or transformed input(s) in the LGD model and where for the purpose of this estimation these input(s) are adjusted to reflect the impact of the downturn period under consideration. In particular, where the considered economic factor relates to the downturn period under consideration, the haircut should be based on the most severe observation of this economic factor in accordance with the specification of the severity of an economic downturn laid down in Article 3 of Regulation (EU) xx/xx [RTS on economic downturn].\n\n32. ('Extrapolation Approach') For the purposes of these guidelines, an 'extrapolation approach' refers to the estimation of the impact of the downturn period under consideration on LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers if all of the following conditions are met: (a) where a statistically significant dependency between the realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers, averaged over appropriate periods in time, and the economic factors selected in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation xx/xxx [RTS on economic downturn] which are relevant for the downturn period under consideration, can be established the resulting estimates are based on the extrapolated values of the average realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers to the period reflecting the impact of the downturn period; (b) where no statistically significant dependency as described in paragraph 32(a) can be established for an intermediate parameter or risk driver, institutions may estimate the impact of the downturn period under consideration on an intermediate parameter or risk driver based on observed data from a different period, where all of following three conditions are met: (i) at least those components of economic loss that explain the major share of the total economic loss should be estimated by either a haircut approach in accordance with paragraph 31 or an extrapolation approach in accordance with paragraph 32(a); (ii) the institution has observed data for the intermediate parameter or risk driver for a sufficient period of time which is at least as long as the period referred to in Article 181(1)(j) or Article 181(2), last subparagraph of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013; this period of time should include a period 48 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY where the economic factor(s) underlying the considered downturn period show values representing adverse economic conditions. (iii) the intermediate parameter or risk driver under consideration shows low volatility in the periods referred to in sub point (ii).\n\n33. Where institutions have observed data covering the downturn period and reflecting the impact of the respective downturn conditions under consideration on an intermediate parameter or risk driver they should use the observed data in combination with the Haircut or Extrapolation Approach to calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period in accordance with paragraph 30.\n\n34. Where institutions apply any of the approaches outlined in paragraphs 31 to 33 for the purpose of estimating intermediate parameters or risk drivers, they should ensure that the dependency structure between intermediate parameters or risk drivers is reflected appropriately in the aggregation of these intermediate parameters or risk drivers in accordance with paragraph 30.\n\n35. To reflect the lack of sufficient loss data, institutions should quantify a strictly positive Category A MoC in accordance with paragraph 37(a)(xi) of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] for all approaches in this section. In particular, institutions applying an extrapolation approach: (a) as referred to in paragraph 32(a), should quantify the Category A MoC by using an appropriate confidence interval to reflect the uncertainty related to the statistical model used to describe the dependency between the realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers and the relevant economic factors; (b) for an intermediate parameter or risk driver as referred to in paragraph 32(b), should quantify the Category A MoC taking into account the ratio of the value(s) of the economic factor(s) underlying the considered downturn period identified in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation xx/xxx [RTS on economic downturn] and value(s) of the relevant economic factor(s) observed in the periods referred to in paragraph 32(b)(ii);\n\n7. Downturn LGD estimation where observed or estimated impact is not available\n\n36. Where the relevant loss data to assess the impact of the downturn period under consideration is not available and it is also not possible to calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period in accordance with Section 6 of these guidelines, institutions 49 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY should quantify downturn LGD through any other approach subject to the following conditions: (a) they should ensure that the appropriate MoC required to be applied in accordance with Section 4.4.3 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] includes a Category A MoC that is strictly positive to account for the missing data; (b) they should ensure that the resulting downturn LGD estimates including the final MoC as set out in paragraph 45 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation], for the considered downturn period are higher or equal to the minimum between . the according long-run average LGDs plus an add-on of 15 percentage points and · 105%; Moreover, they should provide justification to the satisfaction of the competent authority that they cannot calibrate downturn LGD appropriate for the considered downturn period by applying any of the approaches set out in Section 5 and Section 6 of these guidelines.\n\n8. Reference Value\n\n37. Institutions should calculate a reference value in accordance with the following sequence of steps: (a) Using all available loss data, institutions should select the two individual years with the highest observed economic loss by: (i) grouping all defaults according to the year in which the defaults occurred; (ii) for each year as identified in (i) calculating for the defaults that occurred in the considered year the ratio of total economic loss as specified in Section 6.3.1 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] to the total outstanding amount of the according credit obligations at the moment of default; (iii) selecting the two individual years with the highest annual ratio of total economic loss to total outstanding amount resulting from (ii) as the two individual years with the highest observed economic losses. (b) Institutions should calculate the reference value(s) at least for each calibration segment as the simple average of the average realised LGDs from the two individual years with the highest observed economic losses, as identified in paragraph 37(a)(iii). 50 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY\n\n4.

    "paragraph_a_text": "22. For the purpose of calibrating downturn LGD for each considered downturn period identified in accordance with Regulation (EU) xx/xx [RTS on economic downturn], institutions should use one of the three types of approaches set out in Section 5, Section 6 and Section 7 of these guidelines in accordance with the hierarchy set out in paragraphs 23 to 25 below.\n\n23. Where institutions have sufficient and relevant loss data to conduct the impact analysis set out in paragraph 27, they should calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period in accordance with Section 5 of these guidelines. For this purpose, institutions should ensure that the relevant loss data is available during the considered downturn period as well as during an appropriate period before and after the considered downturn period.\n\n24. Where sufficient and relevant loss data to assess the impact of the considered downturn period is not available but it is possible to calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period by applying the approach set out in Section 6, institutions should calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period in accordance with Section 6 of these guidelines.\n\n25. Where sufficient and relevant loss data to assess the impact of the considered downturn period is not available, and it is not possible to quantify downturn LGD for the considered downturn period by applying the approach set out in Section 6, institutions should calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period in accordance with Section 7 of these guidelines.\n\n26. Regardless of the approach used for calibrating downturn LGD institutions should adhere to the following principles (a) where the approach used involves the estimation or analysis of different intermediate parameters, the aggregation of these intermediate parameters for the purpose of calibrating downturn LGD should start with the parameter where the highest impact is observed in accordance with paragraph 27 or estimated in 45 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY accordance with paragraph 30 and any additional impact observed or estimated on other parameters should be added where necessary. (b) The downturn LGD estimates should not be biased by observed or estimated cash flows that are received with a significantly longer time lag than the period referred to in paragraph 156 of [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] and which might rather reflect an upturn or improved economic conditions following the considered downturn period.\n\n5. Downturn LGD estimation based on observed impact\n\n27. In order to calibrate downturn LGD based on the observed impact of a considered downturn period, institutions should carry out an analysis of the impact of this downturn period on the loss data related to the considered calibration segment. (a) The analysis shall comprise at a minimum all of the following: (i) evidence of elevated levels of realised LGDs, driven by the considered downturn period taking into account all of the following:\n\n(1) the realised LGDs should be calculated as averages related to all defaults that occurred in a considered year and that have either reached their maximum time of recovery in accordance with paragraph 156 [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] or have been closed before;\n\n(2) for all incomplete recovery processes of defaulted exposures that have not reached their maximum time of recovery in accordance with paragraph 156 [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation], the marginal recoveries reached in each year after default should be computed. The resulting recovery patterns should be compared to the recovery patterns of the defaults considered in letter (1) for each year in which the defaults occurred. (ii) evidence of decreased annual recoveries by sources of recoveries that are relevant for the considered calibration segment. These annual recoveries should be analysed with and without repossessions where applicable and irrespective of the date of default; (iii) evidence of decreased numbers of exposures that defaulted and returned back to the non-defaulted status within a predefined fixed horizons for all defaults that happened in a considered year in accordance with Article 178(5) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013; The predefined fixed horizon should be appropriate for the type of exposure under consideration. (iv) evidence of increased time in default per year related to all defaults in a considered year. 46 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY (b) The analysis required in paragraph 27(a) shall take into account as many points in time as possible where sufficient relevant loss data is available. Otherwise, if only scarce relevant loss data is available on an annual basis, institutions should merge consecutive years of observations as long as deemed of added value for the analysis. (c) The analysis required in paragraph 27(a) and (b), shall take into account any lag between a downturn period and the time when its potential impact is observed on the relevant loss data.\n\n28. Based on the evidence obtained from the impact analysis referred to in paragraph 27, institutions should calibrate downturn LGD by applying an estimation methodology which is coherent with the evidence obtained from the impact analysis.\n\n29. Where the impact analysis conducted in accordance with paragraph 27 shows no impact of a downturn period on an institution's relevant loss data, such that the average observed realised losses in this downturn period are not different from those under other economic conditions, the institution may use the long-run average LGD as downturn LGD, where all of the following applies: (a) the institution ensures and documents that the deficiencies identified and MoC applied in accordance with Section 4.4 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] incorporate all additional elements of uncertainty related to the identified downturn periods; (b) for the purpose of letter (a), the institution should in particular verify that, for the considered downturn period, none of the deficiencies identified under the Category A, MoC in accordance with paragraph 37(a) of [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] are of higher severity and that no additional deficiencies or adjustments under the Category B MoC in accordance with paragraph 37(b) of [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] are applicable.\n\n6. Downturn LGD estimation based on estimated impact\n\n30. Where paragraph 24 applies, institutions should calibrate downturn LGD using one of the methodologies specified in paragraph 31 ('haircut approach') and paragraph 32 ('extrapolation approach') or a combination of those. Prior to quantifying its downturn LGD estimates, institutions should choose the most relevant methodology based on: (a) the appropriateness of the methodology to estimate the impact of the downturn period under consideration on a realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers; (b) where relevant, the need to use a combination of the methodologies to ensure that the resulting downturn LGDs for the downturn period under consideration adequately reflect a potential downturn impact on all material components of 47 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY economic loss in accordance with Section 6.3.1 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] and in accordance with the principles set out in paragraph 26; In particular the haircut approach should be considered most appropriate for the above purposes where the market value or an according index related to a relevant type of collateral serves as a direct or transformed input into an institution's model for LGD estimation and has been identified as a relevant economic factor in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No xx/xxx [RTS on economic downturn].\n\n31. ('Haircut approach') For the purpose of these guidelines, a 'haircut approach' refers to an approach for the estimation of the impact of the downturn period on realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers in which one or several economic factors as referred to in Regulation (EU) xx/xx [RTS on economic downturn] are direct or transformed input(s) in the LGD model and where for the purpose of this estimation these input(s) are adjusted to reflect the impact of the downturn period under consideration. In particular, where the considered economic factor relates to the downturn period under consideration, the haircut should be based on the most severe observation of this economic factor in accordance with the specification of the severity of an economic downturn laid down in Article 3 of Regulation (EU) xx/xx [RTS on economic downturn].\n\n32. ('Extrapolation Approach') For the purposes of these guidelines, an 'extrapolation approach' refers to the estimation of the impact of the downturn period under consideration on LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers if all of the following conditions are met: (a) where a statistically significant dependency between the realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers, averaged over appropriate periods in time, and the economic factors selected in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation xx/xxx [RTS on economic downturn] which are relevant for the downturn period under consideration, can be established the resulting estimates are based on the extrapolated values of the average realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers to the period reflecting the impact of the downturn period; (b) where no statistically significant dependency as described in paragraph 32(a) can be established for an intermediate parameter or risk driver, institutions may estimate the impact of the downturn period under consideration on an intermediate parameter or risk driver based on observed data from a different period, where all of following three conditions are met: (i) at least those components of economic loss that explain the major share of the total economic loss should be estimated by either a haircut approach in accordance with paragraph 31 or an extrapolation approach in accordance with paragraph 32(a); (ii) the institution has observed data for the intermediate parameter or risk driver for a sufficient period of time which is at least as long as the period referred to in Article 181(1)(j) or Article 181(2), last subparagraph of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013; this period of time should include a period 48 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY where the economic factor(s) underlying the considered downturn period show values representing adverse economic conditions. (iii) the intermediate parameter or risk driver under consideration shows low volatility in the periods referred to in sub point (ii).\n\n33. Where institutions have observed data covering the downturn period and reflecting the impact of the respective downturn conditions under consideration on an intermediate parameter or risk driver they should use the observed data in combination with the Haircut or Extrapolation Approach to calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period in accordance with paragraph 30.\n\n34. Where institutions apply any of the approaches outlined in paragraphs 31 to 33 for the purpose of estimating intermediate parameters or risk drivers, they should ensure that the dependency structure between intermediate parameters or risk drivers is reflected appropriately in the aggregation of these intermediate parameters or risk drivers in accordance with paragraph 30.\n\n35. To reflect the lack of sufficient loss data, institutions should quantify a strictly positive Category A MoC in accordance with paragraph 37(a)(xi) of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] for all approaches in this section. In particular, institutions applying an extrapolation approach: (a) as referred to in paragraph 32(a), should quantify the Category A MoC by using an appropriate confidence interval to reflect the uncertainty related to the statistical model used to describe the dependency between the realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers and the relevant economic factors; (b) for an intermediate parameter or risk driver as referred to in paragraph 32(b), should quantify the Category A MoC taking into account the ratio of the value(s) of the economic factor(s) underlying the considered downturn period identified in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation xx/xxx [RTS on economic downturn] and value(s) of the relevant economic factor(s) observed in the periods referred to in paragraph 32(b)(ii);\n\n7. Downturn LGD estimation where observed or estimated impact is not available\n\n36. Where the relevant loss data to assess the impact of the downturn period under consideration is not available and it is also not possible to calibrate downturn LGD for the considered downturn period in accordance with Section 6 of these guidelines, institutions 49 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY should quantify downturn LGD through any other approach subject to the following conditions: (a) they should ensure that the appropriate MoC required to be applied in accordance with Section 4.4.3 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] includes a Category A MoC that is strictly positive to account for the missing data; (b) they should ensure that the resulting downturn LGD estimates including the final MoC as set out in paragraph 45 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation], for the considered downturn period are higher or equal to the minimum between . the according long-run average LGDs plus an add-on of 15 percentage points and · 105%; Moreover, they should provide justification to the satisfaction of the competent authority that they cannot calibrate downturn LGD appropriate for the considered downturn period by applying any of the approaches set out in Section 5 and Section 6 of these guidelines.\n\n8. Reference Value\n\n37. Institutions should calculate a reference value in accordance with the following sequence of steps: (a) Using all available loss data, institutions should select the two individual years with the highest observed economic loss by: (i) grouping all defaults according to the year in which the defaults occurred; (ii) for each year as identified in (i) calculating for the defaults that occurred in the considered year the ratio of total economic loss as specified in Section 6.3.1 of the [EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation] to the total outstanding amount of the according credit obligations at the moment of default; (iii) selecting the two individual years with the highest annual ratio of total economic loss to total outstanding amount resulting from (ii) as the two individual years with the highest observed economic losses.

In order to overcome biases in risk parameter estimates stemming from the identified deficiencies referred to in paragraphs 36 and 37, institutions should apply adequate methodologies to correct the identified deficiencies to the extent possible.

    "paragraph_b_text": "4.1: Do you agree with the proposed requirements with regard to the application of appropriate adjustments and margin of conservatism? Do you have any operational concerns with respect to the proposed categorisation? MoC general framework One respondent wondered whether the categories and examples included in the background and rationale section of the CP should be seen as a checklist of potential triggers of MoC, in the sense that the potential outcome for an institution may be a zero MoC for certain triggers. One respondent agreed that this should be the case, but another respondent argued that such a checklist would be strictly interpreted by supervisors as requiring an MoC for each individual category. This respondent disagreed with this annex. Due to the confusion about the nature of the list of triggers of MoC in the background and rationale section of the CP, the list has been removed from the final GL. Due to the specificities of triggers of MoC, it is deemed more appropriate to allow institutions to specify a list of all identified deficiencies along with the categories in which they are classified, without including in the GL an example of what such list of triggers might look like. Nevertheless, the GL do contain a non-exhaustive list of triggers of MoC, which institutions should analyse under the relevant categories. Institutions should also create for each rating system a complete list of Changes to the background and rationale section 123 GUIDELINES ON PD ESTIMATION, LGD ESTIMATION AND TREATMENT DEFAULTED EXPOSURES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received EBA analysis Amendments to the proposals references to final GL all identified deficiencies, including the categories in which these deficiencies are classified. Whereas several respondents welcomed the clarification of the MoC and adjustment framework set out in the GL, many raised concerns with respect to the practical feasibility of quantifying all MoCs for the individual categories. Some also mentioned that institutions currently already include adjustments and MoC in their estimations. Some respondents wondered whether the benefits of the proposed framework outweighed the costs. One bank argued that it would be operationally difficult to implement this framework by end-2020. One respondent argued that an MoC should only be applied as a last-resort measure, and that other ways to address a deficiency should be explored first. One respondent argued that the MoC framework introduced judgement and subjectivity, which comes at the expense of risk sensitivity. Based on this feedback, it has been decided to construct a different list of categories, which should facilitate the quantification of MoC by category, so that overlaps between triggers of MoC in different categories can be avoided. The new categories to be identified are the following: category A - MOC related to data and methodological deficiencies; category B - MoC related to relevant changes to underwriting standards, risk appetite, collection and recovery policies, and any other source of additional uncertainty; category C - general estimation error. The GL contain a non-exhaustive list of deficiencies that would fall into categories A and B. Changes to section 4.4 Some respondents opined that the scope of MoCs should be clarified, as should the methodologies that should be used (i.e. using confidence intervals or otherwise). Others mentioned that the GL should specify how the quantification should be performed. Although the EBA considered specifying how MoC should be quantified, it has been taken into account that a wide variety of practices exists, which corresponds to the different possible natures of the potential deficiencies and uncertainties. Therefore, the preferred approach, taken in the GL, is to specify a list of minimum conditions for the quantification of MoCs in each category, without prescribing a detailed methodology. As regards the clarification of the scope of MoC, it should be mentioned that an MoC should cover at least the expected range of Changes to section 4.4.3 124 GUIDELINES ON PD ESTIMATION, LGD ESTIMATION AND TREATMENT DEFAULTED EXPOSURES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received EBA analysis Amendments to the proposals references to final GL estimation errors, as required by Article 179(1)(f) and Article 180(1)(e) of the CRR. Since it would be impossible to anticipate all possible triggers of MoC, the GL contain a non-exhaustive list of potential deficiencies. Several respondents requested that the GL clarify that an MoC may be zero. It is specified in the GL that an MoC stemming from category C (general estimation error) should be greater than zero, whereas an MoC corresponding to category A or B should be greater than or equal to zero. Changes to paragraph 47 One respondent mentioned that the GL should clarify whether an adjustment may be negative, that an MoC may also be positive, and whether adjustments and MoC may or should be used together. Paragraph 26 of the CP on the GL already makes clear that the appropriate adjustment may be either positive or negative. This clarification has been retained in the final GL in paragraph 39. No change Some respondents requested clarification of the interaction between the use test and the MoC. Two respondents wonder whether it would still be possible to pass the use test after the implementation of the MoC framework under the GL. It was argued that institutions might typically want to use the model with the economic adjustment, and without the MoC, or with a lower MoC than the regulatory requirement, for their internal purposes. A new section 8.3. has been inserted in the final GL in order to clarify aspects related to the use test. The GL provide an exhaustive list of possible deviations from the parameters used for own funds requirements calculation that can be applied for internal purposes. However, the use of parameters in both obligatory and optional areas of the use test does not preclude taking into account information from other sources as well. The combination of the information on internal ratings or risk parameters and any other relevant information should lead to an appropriate management decision in accordance with the institution's policy. The requirements for the use test specified in these GL should be read New section 8.3 125 GUIDELINES ON PD ESTIMATION, LGD ESTIMATION AND TREATMENT DEFAULTED EXPOSURES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received EBA analysis Amendments to the proposals references to final GL together with the RTS on IRB assessment methodology, which in Articles 18 to 21 specify obligatory and optional areas of the use test. One respondent argued that the MoC framework proposed in the GL should be applied only to new model approvals and material model changes, and that it would be inappropriate to require retrospective application of the framework to existing models. Another respondent flagged this aspect as well, pointing out that the treatment of existing models is not clear from the GL. The EBA issued its Opinion on the implementation of the revision of the IRB Approach 14 in February 2016; the expected implementation timeline is specified in it based on previous consultations. In this opinion, it is established that the full review of internal models should be implemented by end-2020. The MoC framework is an integral part of PD and LGD estimation, and hence all internal models will have to comply with the final GL as well as the other aspects of the new regulatory framework by end- 2020. No change Identification of deficiencies Several respondents argued that the EBA should provide definitions for the categories and methodological aspects of MoC estimation. It was mentioned that the differences between categories A, B, C and D were not clear. It was also suggested that further standardisation of the criteria for the adjustments and MoC identification and quantification should be provided. For some respondents, it was mainly category C that was unclear. Some mentioned that, without this clarification, the MoC framework would lead to even less comparable estimates among banks. The EBA has further discussed the scope and definitions of the various categories.

Note that paragraph 38 of the final GL contains a non-exhaustive list of potential deficiencies that should be analysed. Given the divergent nature of deficiencies and the multitude of possible methodologies that can be used to assess the appropriate adjustments and the MoC, it would not be beneficial to specify or limit methodologies for either the appropriate adjustments or the Changes to section 4.4",

    "paragraph_b_text": "132. Institutions should be aware that relevant risk parameters related to operational risk may derive from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, including legal risks, or from external events, and may affect all products and activities within the institution.\n\n133. . In order to stress relevant risk parameters, institutions should use the profit and loss (P&L) effect of operational losses as the main metric. Any intrinsic impact caused by the operational risk event should be considered as an operational risk loss (e.g. intrinsic impacts from opportunity costs, or internal costs such as overtime/bonuses, etc., where they relate to an operational risk event). In addition, and only for the purpose of stress testing, any loss of future earnings caused by operational risk events (excluding second-line effects on the macroeconomic environment) should be included. At least the institutions under the advanced measurement approach (AMA) should also take these losses into account as they flow into the internal loss database to calculate the additional capital requirements. When using historical data, external data or scenarios as inputs for both P&L and RWA projections, institutions should take into account and avoid possible double-counting effects on the input side. 38 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INSTITUTIONS' STRESS TESTING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY\n\n134. As operational losses may induce second-round effects (i.e. reputational risk), in order to account for such effects, the operational risk stress testing programme should be thoroughly integrated into the institution-wide stress test and should include interconnections with liquidity and own funds requirements. Institutions should analyse at least: a) the exposure of the institution to activities and its associated risk culture and past record of operational losses, with a focus on the level and change in losses and gross income in the past few years; b) the business environment, including geographical locations, in which the institution operates and macroeconomic conditions; c) the evolution in headcount and in balance-sheet size and complexity over the past few years, including structural changes due to corporate events such as mergers and acquisitions; d) changes to significant elements of the information technology infrastructure; e) the degree and orientation of incentivising in compensation schemes; f) the complexity of processes and procedures, products and information technology systems; g) the extent of outsourcing, with regard to the concentration risk associated with all outsourcing arrangements and external market infrastructures; and h) the vulnerability of modelling risk, especially in areas related to the trading of financial instruments, risk measurement and management, and capital allocation.\n\n135. Idiosyncratic risk factors should also be explored and used as inputs for scenario design. Indicatively, institutions under the AMA should stress their business environment and internal control factors (BEICFs).\n\n136. Institutions should consider the interactions of, and individual exposures to, such idiosyncratic risk factors in determining their operational risk exposure.\n\n137. Institutions should analyse carefully the possible interaction of operational risk losses with credit and market risks.\n\n138. The analysis of the stress test events should involve expert judgement, to include at least low-frequency high-severity events.\n\n139. Institutions should design severe but plausible stress events. Assumptions may differ from assumptions used in credit and market risk stress scenarios. When an institution expands its business in the local or in the international markets through mergers and acquisitions, the design of new products or a new business line, the severe but plausible stress test scenarios should be based on expert judgement to overcome the possible lack of historical information.\n\n140. Institutions should build their stress testing programme based on both internal and external data, while analysing carefully: 39 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INSTITUTIONS' STRESS TESTING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY a) the use of scaling factors (e.g. in a situation where external data were scaled down, the scaling may be reduced) and the possible need for additional impacts stemming from changing scaling factors in a stress situation; and b) the criteria for determining the relevance of data (e.g. data on a large loss considered not relevant may be used within the stress test, in addition to Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) requirements).",

Contingencies are situations as defined in section 3 of the Emergency Powers Act. Normal continuity arrangements form the basis for contingency planning for emergency conditions.\n\n(20) As a rule, disruptions last longer in emergency conditions than those accounted for in normal continuity plans. In addition, the risks associated with emergency conditions are generally more serious than those prepared for in continuity plans.\n\n(21) The guidelines for contingency planning included here may also be applied to severe disruptions and crises other than the emergency conditions referred to in the Emergency Powers Act. Serious disruptions and crises may, for example, be caused by serious threats to functioning of staff or destruction of a supervised entity's premises or IT environment.\n\n(22) In its decision of 5 December 2013, the Government set general objectives for maintenance readiness.

In addition, supervised entities should ensure the card payment infrastructure and the functioning of card certification in Finland.\n\n(25) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities ensure that the paralysis or damage of a single function in the IT and data communication systems required for creating central services do not paralyse the whole system. Supervised entities should prepare for disruptions in international and national data communications by establishing standby facilities.

Key data and central functions may be moved within the EU area provided that their lawfulness, security and availability for achieving the service objectives defined in this guideline are ensured.\n\n(27) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities secure the key data required for creating services so that the data essential to the continuity of operations can be recovered, if the actual data processing centres or data therein are destroyed. This type of key data includes at least basic data on customers and customer contracts, for example personal data, and data on customers' asset and liability positions. Recovery of data from separate security backup to generally readable electronic format should be tested.\n\n(28) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities' contingency planning also cover outsourced activities in as far as core functions and services must be maintained during emergency conditions. Contingency planning requirements should be taken into account already when outsourcing contracts are drawn up. Supervised entities subject to contingency planning requirements should evaluate contingency plans drawn up by external suppliers and ensure that they meet prevailing requirements. A supervised entity subject to contingency planning requirements should, for example, test an external supplier's contingency plan in joint trial runs with the supplier.\n\n(29) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities subject to contingency planning requirements ensure that they have adequate resources and capacity to maintain their activities in emergency situations and during severe disruptions. Plans for accessing substitute staff and premises should also be made in advance. Availability of substitute resources should be ensured in advance for situations in which a large part of the supervised entity's staff is absent or part of the entity's main premises, hardware and software have been destroyed, or is not otherwise available, or the entity is prevented from carrying out business over a large geographic area.\n\n(30) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities subject to contingency planning requirements should continue their reporting to the authorities also in emergency conditions.",

Do you have any operational concerns with respect to the proposed categorisation? MoC general framework One respondent wondered whether the categories and examples included in the background and rationale section of the CP should be seen as a checklist of potential triggers of MoC, in the sense that the potential outcome for an institution may be a zero MoC for certain triggers. One respondent agreed that this should be the case, but another respondent argued that such a checklist would be strictly interpreted by supervisors as requiring an MoC for each individual category. This respondent disagreed with this annex. Due to the confusion about the nature of the list of triggers of MoC in the background and rationale section of the CP, the list has been removed from the final GL. Due to the specificities of triggers of MoC, it is deemed more appropriate to allow institutions to specify a list of all identified deficiencies along with the categories in which they are classified, without including in the GL an example of what such list of triggers might look like. Nevertheless, the GL do contain a non-exhaustive list of triggers of MoC, which institutions should analyse under the relevant categories. Institutions should also create for each rating system a complete list of Changes to the background and rationale section 123 GUIDELINES ON PD ESTIMATION, LGD ESTIMATION AND TREATMENT DEFAULTED EXPOSURES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received EBA analysis Amendments to the proposals references to final GL all identified deficiencies, including the categories in which these deficiencies are classified. Whereas several respondents welcomed the clarification of the MoC and adjustment framework set out in the GL, many raised concerns with respect to the practical feasibility of quantifying all MoCs for the individual categories. Some also mentioned that institutions currently already include adjustments and MoC in their estimations. Some respondents wondered whether the benefits of the proposed framework outweighed the costs. One bank argued that it would be operationally difficult to implement this framework by end-2020. One respondent argued that an MoC should only be applied as a last-resort measure, and that other ways to address a deficiency should be explored first. One respondent argued that the MoC framework introduced judgement and subjectivity, which comes at the expense of risk sensitivity. Based on this feedback, it has been decided to construct a different list of categories, which should facilitate the quantification of MoC by category, so that overlaps between triggers of MoC in different categories can be avoided. The new categories to be identified are the following: category A - MOC related to data and methodological deficiencies; category B - MoC related to relevant changes to underwriting standards, risk appetite, collection and recovery policies, and any other source of additional uncertainty; category C - general estimation error. The GL contain a non-exhaustive list of deficiencies that would fall into categories A and B. Changes to section 4.4 Some respondents opined that the scope of MoCs should be clarified, as should the methodologies that should be used (i.e. using confidence intervals or otherwise). Others mentioned that the GL should specify how the quantification should be performed. Although the EBA considered specifying how MoC should be quantified, it has been taken into account that a wide variety of practices exists, which corresponds to the different possible natures of the potential deficiencies and uncertainties. Therefore, the preferred approach, taken in the GL, is to specify a list of minimum conditions for the quantification of MoCs in each category, without prescribing a detailed methodology. As regards the clarification of the scope of MoC, it should be mentioned that an MoC should cover at least the expected range of Changes to section 4.4.3 124 GUIDELINES ON PD ESTIMATION, LGD ESTIMATION AND TREATMENT DEFAULTED EXPOSURES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received EBA analysis Amendments to the proposals references to final GL estimation errors, as required by Article 179(1)(f) and Article 180(1)(e) of the CRR. Since it would be impossible to anticipate all possible triggers of MoC, the GL contain a non-exhaustive list of potential deficiencies. Several respondents requested that the GL clarify that an MoC may be zero. It is specified in the GL that an MoC stemming from category C (general estimation error) should be greater than zero, whereas an MoC corresponding to category A or B should be greater than or equal to zero. Changes to paragraph 47 One respondent mentioned that the GL should clarify whether an adjustment may be negative, that an MoC may also be positive, and whether adjustments and MoC may or should be used together. Paragraph 26 of the CP on the GL already makes clear that the appropriate adjustment may be either positive or negative. This clarification has been retained in the final GL in paragraph 39. No change Some respondents requested clarification of the interaction between the use test and the MoC.

Institutions should be aware that relevant risk parameters related to operational risk may derive from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, including legal risks, or from external events, and may affect all products and activities within the institution.\n\n133. . In order to stress relevant risk parameters, institutions should use the profit and loss (P&L) effect of operational losses as the main metric. Any intrinsic impact caused by the operational risk event should be considered as an operational risk loss (e.g. intrinsic impacts from opportunity costs, or internal costs such as overtime/bonuses, etc., where they relate to an operational risk event). In addition, and only for the purpose of stress testing, any loss of future earnings caused by operational risk events (excluding second-line effects on the macroeconomic environment) should be included. At least the institutions under the advanced measurement approach (AMA) should also take these losses into account as they flow into the internal loss database to calculate the additional capital requirements. When using historical data, external data or scenarios as inputs for both P&L and RWA projections, institutions should take into account and avoid possible double-counting effects on the input side. 38 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INSTITUTIONS' STRESS TESTING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY\n\n134. As operational losses may induce second-round effects (i.e. reputational risk), in order to account for such effects, the operational risk stress testing programme should be thoroughly integrated into the institution-wide stress test and should include interconnections with liquidity and own funds requirements. Institutions should analyse at least: a) the exposure of the institution to activities and its associated risk culture and past record of operational losses, with a focus on the level and change in losses and gross income in the past few years; b) the business environment, including geographical locations, in which the institution operates and macroeconomic conditions; c) the evolution in headcount and in balance-sheet size and complexity over the past few years, including structural changes due to corporate events such as mergers and acquisitions; d) changes to significant elements of the information technology infrastructure; e) the degree and orientation of incentivising in compensation schemes; f) the complexity of processes and procedures, products and information technology systems; g) the extent of outsourcing, with regard to the concentration risk associated with all outsourcing arrangements and external market infrastructures; and h) the vulnerability of modelling risk, especially in areas related to the trading of financial instruments, risk measurement and management, and capital allocation.\n\n135. Idiosyncratic risk factors should also be explored and used as inputs for scenario design. Indicatively, institutions under the AMA should stress their business environment and internal control factors (BEICFs).\n\n136. Institutions should consider the interactions of, and individual exposures to, such idiosyncratic risk factors in determining their operational risk exposure.\n\n137. Institutions should analyse carefully the possible interaction of operational risk losses with credit and market risks.\n\n138. The analysis of the stress test events should involve expert judgement, to include at least low-frequency high-severity events.\n\n139. Institutions should design severe but plausible stress events. Assumptions may differ from assumptions used in credit and market risk stress scenarios. When an institution expands its business in the local or in the international markets through mergers and acquisitions, the design of new products or a new business line, the severe but plausible stress test scenarios should be based on expert judgement to overcome the possible lack of historical information.\n\n140. Institutions should build their stress testing programme based on both internal and external data, while analysing carefully: 39 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INSTITUTIONS' STRESS TESTING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY a) the use of scaling factors (e.g. in a situation where external data were scaled down, the scaling may be reduced) and the possible need for additional impacts stemming from changing scaling factors in a stress situation; and b) the criteria for determining the relevance of data (e.g. data on a large loss considered not relevant may be used within the stress test, in addition to Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) requirements).",

Whereas several respondents welcomed the clarification of the MoC and adjustment framework set out in the GL, many raised concerns with respect to the practical feasibility of quantifying all MoCs for the individual categories. Some also mentioned that institutions currently already include adjustments and MoC in their estimations. Some respondents wondered whether the benefits of the proposed framework outweighed the costs. One bank argued that it would be operationally difficult to implement this framework by end-2020. One respondent argued that an MoC should only be applied as a last-resort measure, and that other ways to address a deficiency should be explored first. One respondent argued that the MoC framework introduced judgement and subjectivity, which comes at the expense of risk sensitivity. Based on this feedback, it has been decided to construct a different list of categories, which should facilitate the quantification of MoC by category, so that overlaps between triggers of MoC in different categories can be avoided. The new categories to be identified are the following: category A - MOC related to data and methodological deficiencies; category B - MoC related to relevant changes to underwriting standards, risk appetite, collection and recovery policies, and any other source of additional uncertainty; category C - general estimation error. The GL contain a non-exhaustive list of deficiencies that would fall into categories A and B. Changes to section 4.4 Some respondents opined that the scope of MoCs should be clarified, as should the methodologies that should be used (i.e. using confidence intervals or otherwise). Others mentioned that the GL should specify how the quantification should be performed. Although the EBA considered specifying how MoC should be quantified, it has been taken into account that a wide variety of practices exists, which corresponds to the different possible natures of the potential deficiencies and uncertainties. Therefore, the preferred approach, taken in the GL, is to specify a list of minimum conditions for the quantification of MoCs in each category, without prescribing a detailed methodology.

Whereas several respondents welcomed the clarification of the MoC and adjustment framework set out in the GL, many raised concerns with respect to the practical feasibility of quantifying all MoCs for the individual categories. Some also mentioned that institutions currently already include adjustments and MoC in their estimations. Some respondents wondered whether the benefits of the proposed framework outweighed the costs. One bank argued that it would be operationally difficult to implement this framework by end-2020. One respondent argued that an MoC should only be applied as a last-resort measure, and that other ways to address a deficiency should be explored first. One respondent argued that the MoC framework introduced judgement and subjectivity, which comes at the expense of risk sensitivity. Based on this feedback, it has been decided to construct a different list of categories, which should facilitate the quantification of MoC by category, so that overlaps between triggers of MoC in different categories can be avoided. The new categories to be identified are the following: category A - MOC related to data and methodological deficiencies; category B - MoC related to relevant changes to underwriting standards, risk appetite, collection and recovery policies, and any other source of additional uncertainty; category C - general estimation error. The GL contain a non-exhaustive list of deficiencies that would fall into categories A and B. Changes to section 4.4 Some respondents opined that the scope of MoCs should be clarified, as should the methodologies that should be used (i.e. using confidence intervals or otherwise). Others mentioned that the GL should specify how the quantification should be performed. Although the EBA considered specifying how MoC should be quantified, it has been taken into account that a wide variety of practices exists, which corresponds to the different possible natures of the potential deficiencies and uncertainties. Therefore, the preferred approach, taken in the GL, is to specify a list of minimum conditions for the quantification of MoCs in each category, without prescribing a detailed methodology. As regards the clarification of the scope of MoC, it should be mentioned that an MoC should cover at least the expected range of Changes to section 4.4.3 124 GUIDELINES ON PD ESTIMATION, LGD ESTIMATION AND TREATMENT DEFAULTED EXPOSURES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received EBA analysis Amendments to the proposals references to final GL estimation errors, as required by Article 179(1)(f) and Article 180(1)(e) of the CRR. Since it would be impossible to anticipate all possible triggers of MoC, the GL contain a non-exhaustive list of potential deficiencies. Several respondents requested that the GL clarify that an MoC may be zero. It is specified in the GL that an MoC stemming from category C (general estimation error) should be greater than zero, whereas an MoC corresponding to category A or B should be greater than or equal to zero. Changes to paragraph 47 One respondent mentioned that the GL should clarify whether an adjustment may be negative, that an MoC may also be positive, and whether adjustments and MoC may or should be used together. Paragraph 26 of the CP on the GL already makes clear that the appropriate adjustment may be either positive or negative. This clarification has been retained in the final GL in paragraph 39. No change Some respondents requested clarification of the interaction between the use test and the MoC. Two respondents wonder whether it would still be possible to pass the use test after the implementation of the MoC framework under the GL. It was argued that institutions might typically want to use the model with the economic adjustment, and without the MoC, or with a lower MoC than the regulatory requirement, for their internal purposes. A new section 8.3. has been inserted in the final GL in order to clarify aspects related to the use test. The GL provide an exhaustive list of possible deviations from the parameters used for own funds requirements calculation that can be applied for internal purposes. However, the use of parameters in both obligatory and optional areas of the use test does not preclude taking into account information from other sources as well. The combination of the information on internal ratings or risk parameters and any other relevant information should lead to an appropriate management decision in accordance with the institution's policy.

One respondent argued that the MoC framework proposed in the GL should be applied only to new model approvals and material model changes, and that it would be inappropriate to require retrospective application of the framework to existing models. Another respondent flagged this aspect as well, pointing out that the treatment of existing models is not clear from the GL. The EBA issued its Opinion on the implementation of the revision of the IRB Approach 14 in February 2016; the expected implementation timeline is specified in it based on previous consultations. In this opinion, it is established that the full review of internal models should be implemented by end-2020. The MoC framework is an integral part of PD and LGD estimation, and hence all internal models will have to comply with the final GL as well as the other aspects of the new regulatory framework by end- 2020. No change Identification of deficiencies Several respondents argued that the EBA should provide definitions for the categories and methodological aspects of MoC estimation.

Contingencies are situations as defined in section 3 of the Emergency Powers Act. Normal continuity arrangements form the basis for contingency planning for emergency conditions.\n\n(20) As a rule, disruptions last longer in emergency conditions than those accounted for in normal continuity plans. In addition, the risks associated with emergency conditions are generally more serious than those prepared for in continuity plans.\n\n(21) The guidelines for contingency planning included here may also be applied to severe disruptions and crises other than the emergency conditions referred to in the Emergency Powers Act. Serious disruptions and crises may, for example, be caused by serious threats to functioning of staff or destruction of a supervised entity's premises or IT environment.\n\n(22) In its decision of 5 December 2013, the Government set general objectives for maintenance readiness. The guidelines for contingency planning issued by the Financial Maintenance Pool in 2009 provide more specific contingency planning objectives and more detailed guidelines for contingency planning. Guideline (paragraphs 23-30)\n\n(23) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities, based on a risk analysis, consider whether central and significant production systems used for creating services and the know-how for guiding, maintaining, handling and technically supporting them should be exclusively or substantially maintained in Finland or whether it is sufficient that they can be returned to Finland according to pre-planned arrangements.\n\n(24) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities provide standby facilities for ensuring interbank payments, clearing, settlement and custody of securities, and payment of pensions and other regular transactions also in situations where critical systems for these functions are not available in or outside of Finland. In addition, supervised entities should ensure the card payment infrastructure and the functioning of card certification in Finland.\n\n(25) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities ensure that the paralysis or damage of a single function in the IT and data communication systems required for creating central services do not paralyse the whole system. Supervised entities should prepare for disruptions in international and national data communications by establishing standby facilities. FIN-FSA FINANCIAL SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY Regulations and guidelines 8/2014 Issued Valid from 4.11.2014 1.2.2015 until further notice S FIN FIN FIN CIN A 32 (41)\n\n(26) The FIN-FSA recommends that IT systems and data warehouses required for creating central services be geographically separated into at least two places with different risk profiles. Key data and central functions may be moved within the EU area provided that their lawfulness, security and availability for achieving the service objectives defined in this guideline are ensured.\n\n(27) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities secure the key data required for creating services so that the data essential to the continuity of operations can be recovered, if the actual data processing centres or data therein are destroyed. This type of key data includes at least basic data on customers and customer contracts, for example personal data, and data on customers' asset and liability positions. Recovery of data from separate security backup to generally readable electronic format should be tested.\n\n(28) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities' contingency planning also cover outsourced activities in as far as core functions and services must be maintained during emergency conditions. Contingency planning requirements should be taken into account already when outsourcing contracts are drawn up. Supervised entities subject to contingency planning requirements should evaluate contingency plans drawn up by external suppliers and ensure that they meet prevailing requirements. A supervised entity subject to contingency planning requirements should, for example, test an external supplier's contingency plan in joint trial runs with the supplier.\n\n(29) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities subject to contingency planning requirements ensure that they have adequate resources and capacity to maintain their activities in emergency situations and during severe disruptions. Plans for accessing substitute staff and premises should also be made in advance. Availability of substitute resources should be ensured in advance for situations in which a large part of the supervised entity's staff is absent or part of the entity's main premises, hardware and software have been destroyed, or is not otherwise available, or the entity is prevented from carrying out business over a large geographic area.\n\n(30) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities subject to contingency planning requirements should continue their reporting to the authorities also in emergency conditions.",

Some respondents wondered whether the benefits of the proposed framework outweighed the costs. One bank argued that it would be operationally difficult to implement this framework by end-2020. One respondent argued that an MoC should only be applied as a last-resort measure, and that other ways to address a deficiency should be explored first. One respondent argued that the MoC framework introduced judgement and subjectivity, which comes at the expense of risk sensitivity. Based on this feedback, it has been decided to construct a different list of categories, which should facilitate the quantification of MoC by category, so that overlaps between triggers of MoC in different categories can be avoided. The new categories to be identified are the following: category A - MOC related to data and methodological deficiencies; category B - MoC related to relevant changes to underwriting standards, risk appetite, collection and recovery policies, and any other source of additional uncertainty; category C - general estimation error. The GL contain a non-exhaustive list of deficiencies that would fall into categories A and B. Changes to section 4.4 Some respondents opined that the scope of MoCs should be clarified, as should the methodologies that should be used (i.e. using confidence intervals or otherwise). Others mentioned that the GL should specify how the quantification should be performed. Although the EBA considered specifying how MoC should be quantified, it has been taken into account that a wide variety of practices exists, which corresponds to the different possible natures of the potential deficiencies and uncertainties. Therefore, the preferred approach, taken in the GL, is to specify a list of minimum conditions for the quantification of MoCs in each category, without prescribing a detailed methodology. As regards the clarification of the scope of MoC, it should be mentioned that an MoC should cover at least the expected range of Changes to section 4.4.3 124 GUIDELINES ON PD ESTIMATION, LGD ESTIMATION AND TREATMENT DEFAULTED EXPOSURES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received EBA analysis Amendments to the proposals references to final GL estimation errors, as required by Article 179(1)(f) and Article 180(1)(e) of the CRR. Since it would be impossible to anticipate all possible triggers of MoC, the GL contain a non-exhaustive list of potential deficiencies. Several respondents requested that the GL clarify that an MoC may be zero. It is specified in the GL that an MoC stemming from category C (general estimation error) should be greater than zero, whereas an MoC corresponding to category A or B should be greater than or equal to zero. Changes to paragraph 47 One respondent mentioned that the GL should clarify whether an adjustment may be negative, that an MoC may also be positive, and whether adjustments and MoC may or should be used together. Paragraph 26 of the CP on the GL already makes clear that the appropriate adjustment may be either positive or negative. This clarification has been retained in the final GL in paragraph 39. No change Some respondents requested clarification of the interaction between the use test and the MoC. Two respondents wonder whether it would still be possible to pass the use test after the implementation of the MoC framework under the GL. It was argued that institutions might typically want to use the model with the economic adjustment, and without the MoC, or with a lower MoC than the regulatory requirement, for their internal purposes. A new section 8.3. has been inserted in the final GL in order to clarify aspects related to the use test. The GL provide an exhaustive list of possible deviations from the parameters used for own funds requirements calculation that can be applied for internal purposes. However, the use of parameters in both obligatory and optional areas of the use test does not preclude taking into account information from other sources as well. The combination of the information on internal ratings or risk parameters and any other relevant information should lead to an appropriate management decision in accordance with the institution's policy. The requirements for the use test specified in these GL should be read New section 8.3 125 GUIDELINES ON PD ESTIMATION, LGD ESTIMATION AND TREATMENT DEFAULTED EXPOSURES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received EBA analysis Amendments to the proposals references to final GL together with the RTS on IRB assessment methodology, which in Articles 18 to 21 specify obligatory and optional areas of the use test. One respondent argued that the MoC framework proposed in the GL should be applied only to new model approvals and material model changes, and that it would be inappropriate to require retrospective application of the framework to existing models. Another respondent flagged this aspect as well, pointing out that the treatment of existing models is not clear from the GL. The EBA issued its Opinion on the implementation of the revision of the IRB Approach 14 in February 2016; the expected implementation timeline is specified in it based on previous consultations. In this opinion, it is established that the full review of internal models should be implemented by end-2020. The MoC framework is an integral part of PD and LGD estimation, and hence all internal models will have to comply with the final GL as well as the other aspects of the new regulatory framework by end- 2020. No change Identification of deficiencies Several respondents argued that the EBA should provide definitions for the categories and methodological aspects of MoC estimation. It was mentioned that the differences between categories A, B, C and D were not clear. It was also suggested that further standardisation of the criteria for the adjustments and MoC identification and quantification should be provided. For some respondents, it was mainly category C that was unclear. Some mentioned that, without this clarification, the MoC framework would lead to even less comparable estimates among banks. The EBA has further discussed the scope and definitions of the various categories. Based on the comments and difficulties associated with certain overlaps, it has been decided to redesign the categories and provide greater clarity where necessary. Note that paragraph 38 of the final GL contains a non-exhaustive list of potential deficiencies that should be analysed. Given the divergent nature of deficiencies and the multitude of possible methodologies that can be used to assess the appropriate adjustments and the MoC, it would not be beneficial to specify or limit methodologies for either the appropriate adjustments or the Changes to section 4.4",

Contingencies are situations as defined in section 3 of the Emergency Powers Act. Normal continuity arrangements form the basis for contingency planning for emergency conditions.\n\n(20) As a rule, disruptions last longer in emergency conditions than those accounted for in normal continuity plans. In addition, the risks associated with emergency conditions are generally more serious than those prepared for in continuity plans.\n\n(21) The guidelines for contingency planning included here may also be applied to severe disruptions and crises other than the emergency conditions referred to in the Emergency Powers Act. Serious disruptions and crises may, for example, be caused by serious threats to functioning of staff or destruction of a supervised entity's premises or IT environment.\n\n(22) In its decision of 5 December 2013, the Government set general objectives for maintenance readiness. The guidelines for contingency planning issued by the Financial Maintenance Pool in 2009 provide more specific contingency planning objectives and more detailed guidelines for contingency planning. Guideline (paragraphs 23-30)\n\n(23) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities, based on a risk analysis, consider whether central and significant production systems used for creating services and the know-how for guiding, maintaining, handling and technically supporting them should be exclusively or substantially maintained in Finland or whether it is sufficient that they can be returned to Finland according to pre-planned arrangements.\n\n(24) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities provide standby facilities for ensuring interbank payments, clearing, settlement and custody of securities, and payment of pensions and other regular transactions also in situations where critical systems for these functions are not available in or outside of Finland. In addition, supervised entities should ensure the card payment infrastructure and the functioning of card certification in Finland.\n\n(25) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities ensure that the paralysis or damage of a single function in the IT and data communication systems required for creating central services do not paralyse the whole system. Supervised entities should prepare for disruptions in international and national data communications by establishing standby facilities.

Key data and central functions may be moved within the EU area provided that their lawfulness, security and availability for achieving the service objectives defined in this guideline are ensured.\n\n(27) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities secure the key data required for creating services so that the data essential to the continuity of operations can be recovered, if the actual data processing centres or data therein are destroyed. This type of key data includes at least basic data on customers and customer contracts, for example personal data, and data on customers' asset and liability positions. Recovery of data from separate security backup to generally readable electronic format should be tested.\n\n(28) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities' contingency planning also cover outsourced activities in as far as core functions and services must be maintained during emergency conditions. Contingency planning requirements should be taken into account already when outsourcing contracts are drawn up.

This type of key data includes at least basic data on customers and customer contracts, for example personal data, and data on customers' asset and liability positions. Recovery of data from separate security backup to generally readable electronic format should be tested.\n\n(28) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities' contingency planning also cover outsourced activities in as far as core functions and services must be maintained during emergency conditions. Contingency planning requirements should be taken into account already when outsourcing contracts are drawn up. Supervised entities subject to contingency planning requirements should evaluate contingency plans drawn up by external suppliers and ensure that they meet prevailing requirements.

    "paragraph_b_text": "(19) The requirements to plan for contingencies is based on the Emergency Powers Act and contingency planning guidelines issued by the authorities. Contingencies are situations as defined in section 3 of the Emergency Powers Act. Normal continuity arrangements form the basis for contingency planning for emergency conditions.\n\n(20) As a rule, disruptions last longer in emergency conditions than those accounted for in normal continuity plans. In addition, the risks associated with emergency conditions are generally more serious than those prepared for in continuity plans.\n\n(21) The guidelines for contingency planning included here may also be applied to severe disruptions and crises other than the emergency conditions referred to in the Emergency Powers Act. Serious disruptions and crises may, for example, be caused by serious threats to functioning of staff or destruction of a supervised entity's premises or IT environment.\n\n(22) In its decision of 5 December 2013, the Government set general objectives for maintenance readiness. The guidelines for contingency planning issued by the Financial Maintenance Pool in 2009 provide more specific contingency planning objectives and more detailed guidelines for contingency planning. Guideline (paragraphs 23-30)\n\n(23) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities, based on a risk analysis, consider whether central and significant production systems used for creating services and the know-how for guiding, maintaining, handling and technically supporting them should be exclusively or substantially maintained in Finland or whether it is sufficient that they can be returned to Finland according to pre-planned arrangements.\n\n(24) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities provide standby facilities for ensuring interbank payments, clearing, settlement and custody of securities, and payment of pensions and other regular transactions also in situations where critical systems for these functions are not available in or outside of Finland. In addition, supervised entities should ensure the card payment infrastructure and the functioning of card certification in Finland.\n\n(25) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities ensure that the paralysis or damage of a single function in the IT and data communication systems required for creating central services do not paralyse the whole system. Supervised entities should prepare for disruptions in international and national data communications by establishing standby facilities. FIN-FSA FINANCIAL SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY Regulations and guidelines 8/2014 Issued Valid from 4.11.2014 1.2.2015 until further notice S FIN FIN FIN CIN A 32 (41)\n\n(26) The FIN-FSA recommends that IT systems and data warehouses required for creating central services be geographically separated into at least two places with different risk profiles. Key data and central functions may be moved within the EU area provided that their lawfulness, security and availability for achieving the service objectives defined in this guideline are ensured.\n\n(27) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities secure the key data required for creating services so that the data essential to the continuity of operations can be recovered, if the actual data processing centres or data therein are destroyed. This type of key data includes at least basic data on customers and customer contracts, for example personal data, and data on customers' asset and liability positions. Recovery of data from separate security backup to generally readable electronic format should be tested.\n\n(28) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities' contingency planning also cover outsourced activities in as far as core functions and services must be maintained during emergency conditions. Contingency planning requirements should be taken into account already when outsourcing contracts are drawn up. Supervised entities subject to contingency planning requirements should evaluate contingency plans drawn up by external suppliers and ensure that they meet prevailing requirements. A supervised entity subject to contingency planning requirements should, for example, test an external supplier's contingency plan in joint trial runs with the supplier.\n\n(29) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities subject to contingency planning requirements ensure that they have adequate resources and capacity to maintain their activities in emergency situations and during severe disruptions. Plans for accessing substitute staff and premises should also be made in advance. Availability of substitute resources should be ensured in advance for situations in which a large part of the supervised entity's staff is absent or part of the entity's main premises, hardware and software have been destroyed, or is not otherwise available, or the entity is prevented from carrying out business over a large geographic area.\n\n(30) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities subject to contingency planning requirements should continue their reporting to the authorities also in emergency conditions.",

Contingencies are situations as defined in section 3 of the Emergency Powers Act. Normal continuity arrangements form the basis for contingency planning for emergency conditions.\n\n(20) As a rule, disruptions last longer in emergency conditions than those accounted for in normal continuity plans. In addition, the risks associated with emergency conditions are generally more serious than those prepared for in continuity plans.\n\n(21) The guidelines for contingency planning included here may also be applied to severe disruptions and crises other than the emergency conditions referred to in the Emergency Powers Act. Serious disruptions and crises may, for example, be caused by serious threats to functioning of staff or destruction of a supervised entity's premises or IT environment.\n\n(22) In its decision of 5 December 2013, the Government set general objectives for maintenance readiness. The guidelines for contingency planning issued by the Financial Maintenance Pool in 2009 provide more specific contingency planning objectives and more detailed guidelines for contingency planning. Guideline (paragraphs 23-30)\n\n(23) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities, based on a risk analysis, consider whether central and significant production systems used for creating services and the know-how for guiding, maintaining, handling and technically supporting them should be exclusively or substantially maintained in Finland or whether it is sufficient that they can be returned to Finland according to pre-planned arrangements.\n\n(24) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities provide standby facilities for ensuring interbank payments, clearing, settlement and custody of securities, and payment of pensions and other regular transactions also in situations where critical systems for these functions are not available in or outside of Finland. In addition, supervised entities should ensure the card payment infrastructure and the functioning of card certification in Finland.\n\n(25) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities ensure that the paralysis or damage of a single function in the IT and data communication systems required for creating central services do not paralyse the whole system. Supervised entities should prepare for disruptions in international and national data communications by establishing standby facilities. FIN-FSA FINANCIAL SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY Regulations and guidelines 8/2014 Issued Valid from 4.11.2014 1.2.2015 until further notice S FIN FIN FIN CIN A 32 (41)\n\n(26) The FIN-FSA recommends that IT systems and data warehouses required for creating central services be geographically separated into at least two places with different risk profiles. Key data and central functions may be moved within the EU area provided that their lawfulness, security and availability for achieving the service objectives defined in this guideline are ensured.\n\n(27) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities secure the key data required for creating services so that the data essential to the continuity of operations can be recovered, if the actual data processing centres or data therein are destroyed. This type of key data includes at least basic data on customers and customer contracts, for example personal data, and data on customers' asset and liability positions. Recovery of data from separate security backup to generally readable electronic format should be tested.\n\n(28) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities' contingency planning also cover outsourced activities in as far as core functions and services must be maintained during emergency conditions. Contingency planning requirements should be taken into account already when outsourcing contracts are drawn up. Supervised entities subject to contingency planning requirements should evaluate contingency plans drawn up by external suppliers and ensure that they meet prevailing requirements. A supervised entity subject to contingency planning requirements should, for example, test an external supplier's contingency plan in joint trial runs with the supplier.\n\n(29) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities subject to contingency planning requirements ensure that they have adequate resources and capacity to maintain their activities in emergency situations and during severe disruptions. Plans for accessing substitute staff and premises should also be made in advance. Availability of substitute resources should be ensured in advance for situations in which a large part of the supervised entity's staff is absent or part of the entity's main premises, hardware and software have been destroyed, or is not otherwise available, or the entity is prevented from carrying out business over a large geographic area.\n\n(30) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities subject to contingency planning requirements should continue their reporting to the authorities also in emergency conditions.",
