            "1.Inappropriate remuneration structures have been a contributing factor to excessive and imprudent risk taking. Poorly designed remuneration policies have potentially detrimental effects on the sound management of risks, control of risk and the risk taking behaviour of individuals. The current remuneration requirements are set by Directive 2013/36/EU (CRD), which came into effect on 1 January 2014. The CRD has been amended by Directive (EU) 2019/8781; the amendments are to be implemented by Member States by 28 December 2020.",
            "2. The remuneration requirements aim to ensure that remuneration policies are consistent with and promote sound and effective risk management, do not provide incentives for excessive risk taking, and are aligned with the long-term interests of the institutions across the EU.",
            "3.To ensure a more proportionate approach, the co-legislator introduced in Article 94(3) the possibility to waive the pay out in instruments and the deferral of variable remuneration. When applied to smaller institutions, those requirements are too burdensome and the cost is not commensurate with the prudential benefits. Similarly, this is the case for staff with low levels of variable remuneration. While those waivers are based on thresholds provided within the amended CRD, Member States have some flexibility in their implementation and the EBA has the power to issue guidelines under Article 94(7) of the CRD to facilitate them in this regard.",
            "4.To reduce the costs for the application of the requirement for listed institutions to pay out remuneration in shares, the co-legislators also introduced for those listed institutions the possibility of using share-linked instruments.",
            "5. The new provisions introduced by Directive 2019/878/EU reinforce the principle of equal pay for male and female workers for equal work or work of equal value which is laid down in Article 157 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Institutions should operate a gender-neutral remuneration policy. In accordance with Article 74(3) of the CRD, the EBA shall issue guidelines, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, on gender- neutral remuneration policies for institutions.",
            "6.The framework for applying remuneration provisions in a group context has also been amended. Subsidiaries that are not institutions, and therefore not subject to the CRD on an individual basis, might be subject to other specific remuneration requirements pursuant to the relevant sector- specific legal acts and if this is the case, such specific requirements should prevail. In principle, remuneration requirements set out in this Directive should therefore not apply on a consolidated basis to such subsidiaries, including financial institutions that are subject to the MiFID, IFD, AIFMD or UCITS Directive, unless Member States make use of their discretion to 1 Directive (EU) 2019/878 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2019 amending Directive 2013/36/EU as regards exempted entities, financial holding companies, mixed financial holding companies, remuneration, supervisory measures and powers and capital conservation measures. 6 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON SOUND REMUNERATION POLICIES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY implement a different approach under Article 109(6) of the CRD.

The guidelines apply on an individual, sub-consolidated and consolidated basis. However, most investment firms will in June 2021, following the implementation into national law of Directive 2019/34/EU (IFD), be subject to a specific remuneration framework for investment firms and the already applicable remuneration framework under MiFID and are therefore no longer subject to the application of Directive 2013/36/EU on an individual basis, nor to the consolidated application of the requirements under Articles 92, 94 and 95 of Directive 2013/36/EU, including the limitation of the ratio between variable and fixed remuneration to 100% (200% with shareholder's approval), unless Member States make use of the national discretion within Article 109(6) of Directive 2013/36/EU.",
            "8.Article 74 of the CRD requires that institutions have robust governance arrangements and remuneration policies and practices that are gender neutral and that are consistent with and promote sound and effective risk management. The EBA has been mandated to issue guidelines, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, on those arrangements, processes and mechanisms and to issue guidelines on gender-neutral remuneration policies.",
            "9.Furthermore, the EBA has been mandated within two years of the date of publication of the guidelines on gender-neutral remuneration policies to issue a report on the application of gender-neutral remuneration policies by institutions.",
            "10.Article 75 of the CRD mandates the EBA to develop guidelines with respect to requirements contained in Articles 92 to 95 of the CRD. The EBA also developed draft implementing technical standards (ITS) on institutions' public disclosures of the information referred to in Titles Il and III of Part Eight of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. Therefore, the section on disclosures has been removed from the Guidelines.",
            "11.These guidelines should be read in conjunction with other relevant EBA guidelines, in particular guidelines concerning internal governance, remuneration policies for sales staff, reporting requirements and the supervisory review and evaluation process and delegated regulations relevant for this area, including on the identification of staff, other instruments for the pay out of variable remuneration and disclosure requirements. Rationale, objective and structure of the guidelines",
            "12.In line with Article 16 of the EBA founding regulation 1093/2010, as amended, the guidelines aim to ensure that a level playing field is preserved amongst institutions within Member States, taking into account the nature, scale and complexity of their activities. The guidelines complete 7 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON SOUND REMUNERATION POLICIES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY the relevant provisions of the CRD and CRR in order to ensure that institutions implement sound remuneration policies that are based on sound governance processes, taking into account the institutions' risk strategy and profile, and align the incentives of staff with the interest of owners and other stakeholders. The review of the guidelines ensures that revisions made within the CRD are reflected in the Guidelines.",
            "13.To this end, guidance is given for both institutions and competent authorities to ensure that a risk-aligned remuneration culture and framework in the financial sector is implemented, maintained and further developed in line with the regulatory requirements. In line with the above-mentioned objectives, the guidelines contain requirements as specified in Directive 2013/36/EU on remuneration policies for all staff and specific provisions on remuneration for staff whose professional activities have a material impact on the institutions' risk profile (identified staff) and their implementation. Remuneration policies and group context",
            "14.The guidelines differentiate between the provisions applicable to all staff and provisions applicable to identified staff. As identified staff have a material impact on the risk profile, it is appropriate that more stringent remuneration policies are applied.",
            "15.The gender-neutral remuneration policy for all staff, including identified staff, must be consistent with and promote sound and effective risk management. The remuneration policy should be consistent with the long-term strategy of the institution including the overall business strategy, the corresponding risk strategy and appetite, including all risk types (e.g. credit, market, operational, liquidity, reputational and other risks). To be sound and effective, risk management must be in line with the respective regulatory requirements, including Articles 74 to 87 of the CRD, the requirements on governance in Articles 88 to 91 of the CRD, the EBA guidelines on internal governance, the requirements on the internal capital adequacy assessment process and the requirements of CRR for specific risk categories, including the respective risk measurement approaches.",
            "16.To set the appropriate incentives for long-term oriented and prudent risk taking, the remuneration policy and practices need to be transparent for staff regarding the fixed remuneration, the variable remuneration and the award criteria used. Fixed remuneration should be permanent, predetermined, non-discretionary and non-revocable. Variable remuneration should be based on performance and in exceptional cases other conditions. Opaque remuneration policies, e.g. where the conditions for payments are not transparent, are discretionary or where adjustments of the remuneration depend unilaterally on the sole discretion of the institution, could have unforeseen effects on staff's behaviour in terms of risk- related decisions and are therefore not consistent with the above principles.",
            "17.Implementing a sound remuneration policy is the responsibility of the management body and, where applicable, the remuneration committee. In practice, the development of a remuneration policy needs to be supported by internal control functions and corporate functions to ensure that appropriate performance and risk measurement tools are used and that contracts between 8 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON SOUND REMUNERATION POLICIES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY institutions and staff ensure that the remuneration policies are applied. Also business units need to be involved in the development of the remuneration policy to ensure that appropriate incentives, in particular for identified staff within the business units, are set. It is important that the remuneration policy is considered in the capital and liquidity planning so that it can contribute to safeguarding a sound capital base and does not lead to shortcomings in the institutions' liquidity.",
            "18.The corporate bodies which have the competencies to approve the remuneration policy may differ among countries due to national corporate law. Additionally, in some countries the corporate body that approves the remuneration policy of the management body may differ from the one that approves the remuneration policy for identified staff in business areas and identified staff in control functions. For these reasons, these guidelines should be read together with the relevant national legal provisions.",
            "19.The body that performs the responsibilities of the management body in its supervisory function may differ among countries due to national corporate law. The EBA is aware that within Member States usually one of two governance structures is used, a unitary or a dual board structure; no particular structure is advocated. Regarding these issues, the EBA guidelines on internal governance should be taken into account.",
            "20.In accordance with the CRD, institutions have to apply the remuneration requirements at group, parent and subsidiary levels, including within subsidiaries that are not themselves subject to the CRD, unless they are themselves subject to specific remuneration requirements on an individual basis under other Union acts or would be subject to such requirements if they were established in the Union. However, under Article 109(5) of the CRD, the remuneration provisions may still apply to individual staff members of certain subsidiaries. As a general principle and taking into account applicable specific remuneration requirements, remuneration policies of different group entities within the scope of prudential consolidation should be consistent with the group's remuneration policy set by the consolidating institution. The remuneration policy needs to comply with the CRD provisions, these guidelines and additional requirements set within national company, labour and other relevant laws.",
            "21.The scope of consolidation includes all institutions, financial institutions, and can include ancillary undertakings that are subsidiaries of the institution that is responsible for the consolidation; where requirements refer to the 'consolidated basis' or 'consolidated situation', the responsible EU parent institution, EU parent financial holding company, EU parent mixed financial holding company, parent institution in a Member State, parent financial holding company in a Member State or parent mixed financial holding company in a Member State is responsible for compliance with the relevant CRD provisions and guidelines. Subject to national discretion, subsidiaries for which other specific sectoral directives (e.g. MiFID, IFD, AIFMD and UCITS Directive) include a specific remuneration framework do not have to be included in the scope of application of the CRD requirements foreseen under Articles 92, 94 and 95 of the CRD on a 'consolidated basis' in accordance with Article 109 of the CRD.

Gender-neutral remuneration policies",
            "22. The principle of equal pay for male and female workers for equal work or work of equal value is laid down in Article 157 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The CRD requires institutions to ensure that they apply a gender-neutral remuneration policy for all staff, including their risk takers, i.e. a remuneration policy based on equal pay for male and female workers for equal work or work of equal value. The same principle applies to workers of all diverse genders when implemented into national law.",
            "23.According to Article 157 of the TFEU, equal pay for equal work or work of equal value includes the ordinary basic or minimum wage or salary and any other consideration, whether in cash or in kind, which the worker receives directly or indirectly, in respect of their employment, from their employer. The TFEU calls for further measures to ensure equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation. However, the principle of equal treatment shall not prevent Member States from maintaining or adopting measures providing for specific advantages in order to make it easier for the underrepresented sex 2 to pursue a vocational activity or to prevent or compensate for disadvantages in professional careers.",
            "24.Where the remuneration of most of the staff is subject to collective bargaining, where such contracts are applicable independent of the gender of staff, it is easier to monitor that remuneration policies are applied in a gender-neutral way. Ensuring gender neutrality with regard to individually agreed contracts is more complex and requires a more sophisticated approach.",
            "25.Member States and employers, in line with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, should strive to avoid any discrimination within the conditions of employment, including discrimination based on gender.",
            "26.Consequently, in addition to ensuring equal pay for the same position or positions of equal value, it is also necessary to ensure equal opportunities for all genders. Equal career prospects help to improve the representation of the underrepresented gender in the management body of institutions in the longer run, by facilitating the existence of a diverse pool of candidates for such positions, e.g. within institutions' senior management."

In addition, it is proposed to replace the term 'earnings' with 'remuneration'; and the term 'hourly' with 'full-time annual remuneration awarded' or 'monthly/yearly remuneration' or 'gross annual remuneration'. In addition, it is proposed to link this definition with the methodology defined in section 2.5 In line with work published by the European Parliament39, the gender pay gap is the difference in average gross hourly earnings between women and men. It is based on salaries paid directly to employees before income tax and social security contributions are deducted. Calculated this way, the gender pay gap does not take into account all the different factors that may play a role, for example education, hours worked, type of job, career breaks or part-time work.

            "7. Valuation of immovable and movable property 57 FINAL REPORT - GUIDELINES ON LOAN ORIGINATION AND MONITORING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Executive Summary The European Banking Authority (EBA) developed the Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring in response to the Council of the European Union's Action Plan on tackling the high level of non-performing exposures. The European Council, in its July 2017 Action Plan, invited the EBA to 'issue detailed guidelines on banks' loan origination, monitoring and internal governance which could in particular address issues such as transparency and borrower affordability assessment'. The objective of the guidelines is to improve institutions' practices and associated governance arrangements, processes and mechanisms in relation to credit granting, in order to ensure that institutions have robust and prudent standards for credit risk taking, management and monitoring, and that newly originated loans are of high credit quality. The guidelines also aim to ensure that the institutions' practices are aligned with consumer protection rules and respect fair treatment of consumers. Through these objectives, the EBA aims to improve the financial stability and resilience of the EU banking system. The guidelines specify the internal governance arrangements, processes and mechanisms, as laid down in Article 74(1) of Directive 2013/36/EU (Capital Requirements Directive, CRD) and further specified in the EBA Guidelines on internal governance, and requirements on credit and counterparty risk, as laid down in Article 79 of Directive 2013/36/EU in relation to the granting and monitoring of credit facilities throughout their life cycle. The guidelines introduce requirements for assessing the borrowers' creditworthiness, together with the handling of information and data for the purposes of such assessments. These guidelines also further specify how to assess the creditworthiness of consumers and use consumer information laid down in Articles 18 and 20 of Directive 2014/17/EU (Mortgage Credit Directive, MCD). Furthermore, the guidelines also recognise the extension of the EBA's scope of action in the review of the European Supervisory Authorities' (ESAs') Founding Regulations and incorporate guidance for the creditworthiness assessment in relation to consumer credit, in accordance with Article 8 of Directive 2008/48/EC on consumer credits (Consumer Credit Directive, CCD). To support the dual focus of the guidelines, bringing together the prudential framework and consumer protection aspects of credit granting, the guidelines, in particular: a. clarify the internal governance and control framework for the credit-granting and credit decision-making process, building on the requirements of the EBA Guidelines on internal governance (Section 4); b. specify requirements for the creditworthiness assessment of borrowers, differentiating between lending to (1) consumers, (2) micro and small enterprises and (3) medium-sized and large enterprises, and set out the requirements for handling information and data for such assessments (Section 5); 4 FINAL REPORT - GUIDELINES ON LOAN ORIGINATION AND MONITORING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY c. set out supervisory expectations for the risk-based pricing of loans (Section 6); d. provide guidance on the approaches to the valuation of immovable and movable property collateral at the point of credit granting, and the monitoring and review of the value of such collateral, based on the outcomes of the monitoring (Section 7); e. specify the ongoing monitoring of credit risk and credit exposures, including regular credit reviews of borrowers (Section 8). The EBA has developed these guidelines building on existing national practices and supervisory experience, and also addressing shortcomings in institutions' credit-granting policies and practices, highlighted by the recent financial crisis. At the same time, the guidelines also reflect supervisory priorities and recent policy developments related to credit granting. In particular, the guidelines account for the growing importance of environmental, social and governance factors, and environmentally sustainable lending, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing, as well as the growing use of automated and statistical models and technology-based innovation in the credit granting and collateral valuation. Next steps The guidelines will be translated into the official EU languages and published on the EBA's website. The deadline for competent authorities to report whether they comply with the guidelines will be 2 months after the publication of the translations. The guidelines will apply from 30 June 2021. 5 FINAL REPORT - GUIDELINES ON LOAN ORIGINATION AND MONITORING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Background and rationale",
            "1. As part of the EU's response to tackling the high level of non-performing exposures, the Council of the European Union in its July 2017 Action Plan1 invited the EBA to 'issue detailed guidelines on banks' loan origination, monitoring and internal governance which could in particular address issues such as transparency and borrower affordability assessment'. The Council stressed that 'these guidelines should leverage on existing national experiences where relevant'.",
            "2. Within the framework of the Council's Action Plan, the EBA has already published Guidelines on management of non-performing and forborne exposures2, Guidelines on disclosures of non- performing and forborne exposures3 and developed non-performing loan (NPL) transaction templates 4, with a view to improving data quality and information symmetry between institutions and investors in the NPL secondary markets in Europe. These previous initiatives aim to tackle problems around loans once they become non-performing, while the Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring have been developed in order to ensure that institutions have prudential loan origination standards in place, in order to prevent newly originated performing loans from becoming non-performing in the future.",
            "3. The guidelines specify the internal governance arrangements, processes and mechanisms, as laid down in Article 74(1) of Directive 2013/36/EU (CRD)5 and further specified in the EBA Guidelines on internal governance6, and requirements on credit and counterparty risk, as laid down in Article 79 of Directive 2013/36/EU in relation to the granting and monitoring of credit facilities throughout their life cycle. The guidelines also set out requirements for the creditworthiness assessment of borrowers, together with the collection of information and data for the purposes of such creditworthiness assessments. These guidelines also further specify the creditworthiness assessment of consumers laid down in Articles 18 and 20 of Directive 2014/17/EU (MCD) 7 and Article 8 of Directive 2008/48/EC on consumer credits (CCD)8.",

            "5. In accordance with Article 8(1)(a) of the EBA Founding Regulation, the EBA, when carrying out its tasks, may take into account the integration of environmental, social and governance (ESG)- related factors. To this end, in accordance with Article 8(1)(a), these guidelines take into account environmental factors for loan origination and also put in place guidance for monitoring material ESG-related risks. Structure of the guidelines",
            "6. The main body of the guidelines comprises five sections: a. Section 4 provides the details for the application of the general internal governance framework, as set out in the EBA Guidelines on internal governance in relation to the credit- granting process. This section looks into the following topics: (1) credit risk governance and culture, also explaining the specific roles of the management body; (2) credit risk appetite, strategy and credit risk limits, explaining how these concepts fit into the institutions' overall risk appetite framework (RAF) and strategy; (3) credit risk policies and procedures, setting out general and specific criteria to be considered in these policies; (4) the credit decision- making process, highlighting the principle of independence between different (e.g. business and risk) functions in decision-making; (5) setting out the requirements for robust and effective credit risk management and internal control frameworks, as part of the institutions' overall risk management and control frameworks; (6) the resources, skills and information technology (IT) and data infrastructure that institutions should have in place for prudent and robust credit decision-making processes; and (7) the application of general remuneration requirements to credit risk granting, with a view to mitigating excessive risk taking in lending activities. In Section 4, the guidelines also set out supervisory expectations for institutions, when their lending activities involve leveraged transactions, technology-enabled innovations, use of automated models in creditworthiness assessments and credit decision-making, an approach to ESG factors and environmentally sustainable lending, and their data infrastructure. Furthermore, Section 4 refers to the application of the anti-money laundering (ALM) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) requirements in the context of credit granting. Institutions should note that loans that pose no credit risk may nevertheless pose money laundering (ML) and terrorist financing risk (TF) risk. In these guidelines, the EBA is introducing prominently environmentally sustainable lending dimensions, and is setting requirements for institutions to consider ESG factors, environmentally sustainable lending and associated risks in their credit policies and procedures. This is a significant step considering the importance of the topic for the EU, 7 FINAL REPORT - GUIDELINES ON LOAN ORIGINATION AND MONITORING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY with the three ESAs separately being mandated to develop reports, guidelines and technical standards related to sustainability. b. The focus of Section 5 is loan origination practices. It specifies (1) the handling and use of documentation of information and data from borrowers for the creditworthiness assessment; (2) assessment of borrowers' creditworthiness; and (3) setting out requirements for credit decisions and loan agreements. The section covers lending to consumers and, with a view to applying the principle of proportionality, provides specific requirements for lending to (1) micro and small enterprises and (2) medium-sized and large enterprises, including both secured and unsecured lending. A set of general requirements for lending to consumers is followed by asset class-/product-specific requirements, including lending to consumers secured by immovable property, lending to consumers secured by other property and unsecured lending to consumers. Similarly, the section sets general requirements for lending to micro and small enterprises and medium-sized and large enterprises. The general requirements are followed by asset class-/product-specific requirements, including commercial real estate (CRE), real estate development, leveraged finance, shipping and project finance. While all sections of the guidelines apply in relation to the granting and monitoring of all credit facilities, excluding derivatives, debt securities and securities financing transactions, Sections 5 and 6 apply in relation to loans and advances only. Furthermore, loans and advances to credit institutions, investment firms, financial institutions, insurance and reinsurance undertakings, central banks and sovereigns, including central governments, regional and local authorities, and public sector entities, are excluded from the scope of application of Sections 5 and 6, as the creditworthiness assessment of these borrowers would significantly differ from the assessment of traditional loans to consumers and enterprises. c. Section 6 sets out supervisory expectations for the risk-based pricing of loans, listing a set of risk-based elements that institutions should consider and reflect when pricing newly originated loans, without prescribing any specific pricing strategies and interfering with business decision-making responsibilities. The objective of this section is to ensure that institutions implement a comprehensive framework for the pricing of loans. This section does not prescribe any particular pricing strategies, as that remains the business responsibility of institutions themselves. d. Section 7 looks at the requirements for the valuation of immovable and movable property collateral (excluding financial collateral) at the point of origination of credit facilities as well as throughout the life cycle of the loans, including monitoring and revaluation (i.e. a review of the value of the collateral). In this section, the guidelines spell out supervisory expectations for independent valuers and conditions that allow advanced statistical models to be used by institutions for the valuation, monitoring and revaluation of various forms of collateral. 8 FINAL REPORT - GUIDELINES ON LOAN ORIGINATION AND MONITORING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY e. Section 8 of the guidelines focuses on supervisory requirements for the ongoing monitoring of credit risk and credit exposures, including regular credit reviews of at least medium-sized and large enterprises. In this section, the EBA also sets out supervisory expectations for the management information systems to be used for monitoring and the framework of early warning indicators/watch lists, thus building the link between the ongoing monitoring and early detection of loans with deteriorating credit quality that are also covered in the EBA Guidelines on management of non-performing and forborne exposures.",
            "7. The guidelines are supported by three annexes presenting a set of considerations for credit- granting criteria (Annex 1), information and data needs for the purposes of creditworthiness assessment (Annex 2), and metrics that can be used in credit granting and monitoring (Annex 3). Interaction between prudential and consumer protection frameworks",
            "8. Sound lending practices employed by institutions for effective assessment of a borrowers' creditworthiness at the point of loan origination are important from both a prudential point of view and a consumer protection perspective. Failure to complete an accurate and thorough creditworthiness assessment may have negative consequences for institutions and borrowers, and affect overall financial stability, as borrowers may not be able to meet their contractual commitments under the loan agreements. As a result, the level of non-performing exposures in the markets may increase. The EBA statutory objectives include both prudential and financial stability as well as consumer protection. To this end, it is important that the guidelines reflect these objectives and address the issues of loan origination and creditworthiness assessments, from both a prudential and a consumer protection angle, as indicated in the Council's Action Plan.",
            "9. The creditor's obligation, prior to the conclusion of the agreement, to assess a borrower's creditworthiness is intended to protect consumers against the risks of over-indebtedness and bankruptcy, and therefore ensure responsible lending. The consumer protection perspective of these guidelines is of particular importance when specifying the requirements for the creditworthiness assessment in the context of lending to consumers and the collection of information and data for this assessment. The requirements of these guidelines provide further details on the creditworthiness assessment of consumers and the verification of consumer information, as laid down in Articles 18 and 20 of Directive 2014/17/EU when dealing with lending secured by residential immovable property and Article 8 of Directive 2008/48/EC when dealing with unsecured consumer lending.",
            "10. The EBA has previously issued guidelines specifying creditworthiness assessment for credit agreements with consumers in respect of credit agreements that fall under the scope of 9 FINAL REPORT - GUIDELINES ON LOAN ORIGINATION AND MONITORING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Article 3 of Directive 2014/17/EU: EBA Guidelines on creditworthiness assessment9. Given the dual focus of the Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring, the EBA decided to fully incorporate the EBA Guidelines on creditworthiness assessment into the new guidelines and repeal them, with effect from the date of application of these guidelines.",
            "11. Incorporating consumer protection aspects into these guidelines and integrating (and repealing) the Guidelines on creditworthiness assessment under the MCD ensure that there is a comprehensive set of guidelines covering creditworthiness assessment from prudential and consumer protection angles, across different types of institutions, asset classes and loan products. This is of particular importance for institutions subject to the CRD, the MCD and the CCD (e.g. credit institutions offering loans falling within the scope of the MCD or consumer loans), which will need to implement only one set of guidelines on creditworthiness assessment.",
            "12. These guidelines take into account the EBA's scope of action, which has been amended through a review of the ESA Founding Regulations. The review brings Directive 2008/48/EC on consumer credits (the CCD) into the EBA's scope of action. The new EBA scope of action is applicable as of 1 January 2020, which means that the new scope is applicable before the application date of these guidelines.",
            "13. While taking into account the protection of consumers' interests, notably with regard to creditworthiness assessment, these guidelines go further, as they require institutions to also take account of those interests in the credit risk policies and procedures, credit-granting criteria and the design of the credit products that are offered to consumers. Proportionality and implementation",
            "14. The implementation of these guidelines is subject to the principle of proportionality, and the proportionality principle is interpreted and applied differently for various sections of the guidelines. First, for the implementation of the requirements related to internal governance, risk management and control, institutions and competent authorities should consider a proportionality principle that is based on, inter alia, the size, nature and complexity of the institutions and other criteria set out for the purposes of the principle of proportionality, defined in the EBA Guidelines on internal governance.",
            "15. Second, when implementing the requirements for the creditworthiness assessment, collateral valuation and credit risk monitoring, competent authorities and institutions, instead of the size and complexity of institutions, should consider the type, size and complexity of the credit facilities being originated or monitored, because these are the main drivers that could give rise to a disproportionate application of the guidelines. Furthermore, the proportionality in the collateral valuation is also driven by the size, nature and complexity of the collateral and the relationship between the loan and collateral, whereas the degree of sophistication of the"

The above differentiation in the application of proportionality aims to ensure that, while even smaller and less complex institutions have a robust and effective credit-granting process, loan origination and monitoring criteria are proportionate to the type, size, complexity and risk profile of the loans that the institutions are originating or credit facilities that they are monitoring.",
            "17. However, under the MCD and the CCD, the concept of proportionality and appropriateness applies in a general way, and not only in relation to size a loan has for the institution or creditor. This is because the main objective of these directives is founded on consumer protection. Building on that, and in order to ensure the full effect of these guidelines with regard to consumer protection, these guidelines also provide that the proportionate application to the size of loan, as set out above, should not result in any impairment of consumer protection, as envisaged in the MCD and the CCD.",
            "18. These guidelines apply from 30 June 2021, meaning that (1) the competent authorities should implement these guidelines by incorporating them into their supervisory processes and procedures, and (2) institutions should implement them in their business practices by 30 June 2021. The guidelines also envisage specific phase-in requirements for addressing data gaps in the monitoring of already existing credit facilities up until 30 June 2024.",
            "19. It should be noted that the requirements for loan origination in Section 5 of these guidelines apply also to loans and advances that already exist on the application date if their terms and conditions have been changed after the application date, provided that the changes follow a specific credit decision approval, and if their implementation requires a new loan agreement with the borrower or an addendum to the existing agreement. 11 FINAL REPORT - GUIDELINES ON LOAN ORIGINATION AND MONITORING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Guidelines EBA/GL/2020/06 29 May 2020 Guidelines on loan origination and monitoring 12 FINAL REPORT - GUIDELINES ON LOAN ORIGINATION AND MONITORING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY",

Over recent years, there has been an increasing tendency by institutions and payment institutions to outsource activities also in order to reduce costs and improve flexibility and efficiency. In the context of digitalisation and the increasing importance of information technology (IT) and financial technologies (fintech), institutions and payment institutions are adapting their business models, processes and systems to embrace such technologies. IT has become one of the most commonly outsourced activities. Notwithstanding its benefits, outsourcing IT and data services poses security issues and challenges to the governance framework of institutions and payment institutions, in particular to internal controls as well as to data management and data protection.",

Some institutions and payment institutions have intensified the use of IT and fintech solutions and have launched projects to improve their cost efficiency also in response to the intermediation margins of the traditional banking lending model being put under pressure by the low interest rate environment. Outsourcing is a way to get relatively easy access to new technologies and to achieve economies of scale, e.g. by centralising functions within a group or institutional protection scheme.",

In 2017, the EBA addressed the specificities of outsourcing to the cloud by developing recommendations on outsourcing to cloud service providers,2 which were based on the 2006 CEBS outsourcing guidelines. The recommendations aimed at overcoming the high level of uncertainty regarding supervisory expectations on outsourcing to cloud service providers and at removing the barriers that this uncertainty caused for institutions proceeding with using cloud services.

If service providers, 14 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY e.g. in the area of IT or fintech, fail or are no longer able to provide their services, including in the case of severe business disruption caused by external events, this may cause systemic risks to the financial market.",
            "46. The need to monitor and manage concentration risk is particularly relevant for certain forms of IT outsourcing, including cloud outsourcing, which is dominated by a small number of highly dominant service providers. For instance, compared with more traditional forms of outsourcing offering tailor-made solutions to clients, cloud outsourcing services are much more standardised, which allows the services to be provided to a larger number of different clients in a much more automated manner and on a larger scale. Although cloud services can offer a number of advantages, such as economies of scale, flexibility, operational efficiencies and cost- effectiveness, they also raise challenges in terms of data protection and location, security issues and concentration risk, not only from the point of view of individual institutions but also at industry level, as large suppliers of IT and cloud services can become a single point of failure when many institutions rely on them.

During the consultation period, the EBA, together with the chair of the EBA's Subgroup on Remuneration and Governance, had meetings with some significant European Associations (the European Banking Federation, the European Association of Co-operative Banks and the European Savings and Retail Banking Group) to discuss their concerns. Altogether, 59 responses were received, including the response of the EBA's Banking Stakeholder Group and nine responses that have not been published.",
            "2. While many respondents acknowledged the efforts undertaken by the EBA to update the outsourcing guidelines and to integrate the EBA's recommendation on outsourcing to cloud service providers, several respondents made suggestions to reduce the scope of the guidelines and the regulatory burden that allegedly would be created by them. The main topics commented on are summarised below. Main comments received during public consultation Scope, definition and date of application",
            "3. Respondents commented that the guidelines' scope of application and the definition of outsourcing were too wide. First, respondents required confirmation that the guidelines do not apply to subsidiaries that are themselves not subject to CRD on a solo basis, but only on a consolidated basis. In particular, the situation of alternative investment funds (AIFs), undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) and third-country subsidiaries should be clarified. Regarding the definition, many respondents provided examples of arrangements that should not be considered as outsourcing and requested the inclusion of a (non-exhaustive) list of arrangements that should not be considered as outsourcing in the guidelines.",
            "4. Respondents also considered that the draft guidelines were too far-reaching, as they extend to arrangements that are not critical or important. They found it too burdensome that the risk assessment and due diligence provisions were in fact applicable to all third-party arrangements. Respondents suggested that the focus be only on the outsourcing of critical and important functions.",
            "5. Respondents considered that the provisions regarding the transitional period were too restrictive. Respondents urged for existing contracts to be exempted from the scope of the new guidelines and for the end date of the transitional period to be postponed. 68 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Proportionality and group application",
            "6. Respondents found that the principle of proportionality had not sufficiently been taken into consideration and that the guidelines were in general too prescriptive. It was suggested that a more risk-based approach should be implemented.",
            "7. Respondents felt that intragroup outsourcing, outsourcing within institutional protection schemes and cooperative networks, and the inherent lower level of operational risks due to the use of common service providers were not sufficiently considered; respondents suggested that lighter requirements be applied in relation to several matters (e.g. governance requirements, conflicts of interest, pre-outsourcing analysis, monitoring and audit requirements, exit rights, business continuity planning, documentation and notification, compliance and reporting obligations). Contractual arrangements",
            "8. Respondents found the contractual requirements too demanding and specific. They requested that a more principle-based approach be adopted and pointed out that certain expectations would raise significant legal and practical challenges, e.g. the inclusion of audit and access rights and the approach to sub-outsourcing that would trigger additional documentation and monitoring burdens. Outsourcing to cloud service providers",
            "9. Respondents suggested that the consideration of cloud services as outsourcing should follow the same principles as other services and technologies and determining whether they should be qualified as important or critical functions should depend on the nature of the activities outsourced. Other respondents would prefer to maintain the recommendation on outsourcing to cloud service providers. Information to competent authorities",
            "10. Regarding the information to be provided to competent authorities, respondents considered that the requirements were burdensome and sometimes had limited supervisory usefulness; this concerns the documentation of all, and not only critical and important, outsourcing arrangements and the need to notify competent authorities of new planned critical or important outsourcing arrangements. In addition, respondents highlighted that the requirement to inform competent authorities about outsourcing arrangements should be removed or converted into an ex post notification and requested confirmation that this is not to be seen as a prior authorisation procedure. Respondents also requested that the register of outsourcing arrangements be limited to critical or important functions. 69 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY The EBA's update of the guidelines",

            "13. The guidelines have been restructured to better mirror the MiFID II approach that (1) defines outsourcing, (2) defines critical and important functions and (3) sets out the requirements for institutions when outsourcing such functions. Considering the general governance requirements for institutions, the requirements for outsourcing of non-critical or non-important functions have been retained in a proportionate manner.",
            "14. The guidelines have been checked for consistency with the EBA recommendation on outsourcing to cloud service providers and the PSD2 requirements on outsourcing.",
            "15. It should be noted that, in general, all of the content of the recommendation on outsourcing to cloud service providers has been retained; however, changes to the approach have been made to ensure consistency with the overall outsourcing framework, which differentiates between the requirements for critical and important outsourcing and those for other, non-material, outsourcing arrangements.",
            "16. The application of the requirements in the context of a group and an institutional protection scheme have been clarified. While the context of groups and institutional protection schemes needs to be taken into account, all institutions remain responsible for compliance with regulatory requirements. 70 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Summary of responses to the consultation and of the EBA's analysis Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals General comments Subject matter, scope and definitions Mandate Some respondents took the view that EBA alone does not have the mandate to set up rules that applied on a (sub-) consolidated basis, given that its mandate and expertise is restricted to banking business models. It has been proposed that cooperation be established between all European Supervisory Authorities to ensure a proportional approach to different businesses. Article 74 CRD requires that the EBA develop guidelines on governance; this includes developing guidelines on outsourcing. The guidelines take into account other relevant European legislation. There is close cooperation between all three European Supervisory Authorities. The guidelines are in line with Article 109 CRD, which requires that governance requirements be applied on a sub-consolidated and a consolidated basis. No change One respondent commented that extending the CRD rules to subsidiaries that are subject to sector-specific rules, for which the EBA has no competence, is an infringement of the EBA's legal mandate. Regulatory changes A few respondents suggested that upcoming regulatory changes (CRD V, CRR2, investment firms) should be taken into account. The EBA can base its guidelines only on the current applicable EU legal framework. When new directives or regulations are adopted, the EBA will review its guidelines where necessary. No change Empty shell One respondent asked for a more detailed explanation of when an institution is regarded as an 'empty shell'. Please refer to the EBA opinion on issues related to the departure of the United Kingdom from the EU. No change Implementation across Member States A few respondents asked for clarification on how the preferential treatment of intragroup structures is applied across different regulated jurisdictions (in and outside the EU). In general, Member States should implement the specific requirements regarding the group application in line with Article 109 CRD. However, some Member States may impose No change 71 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals additional requirements, as the guidelines are subject to a comply or explain approach. Definitions Some respondents requested that additional definitions be added to the guidelines that are already included in other directives or regulations (e.g. definitions of institution, credit institution, etc.) The guidelines should not duplicate definitions that are already in force and included in Level-1 text (e. g. in the CRD, CRR or PSD). No change Prescriptiveness Many respondents highlighted that the guidelines should maintain sufficient flexibility for EU institutions to react and adapt to market innovations and should not introduce burdensome requirements or restrictions, which could potentially reduce competition and/or increase the costs associated with the supply of services to institutions. Respondents suggested that the guidelines should differentiate between regulatory requirements (which are mandatory) and guidance (which allows flexible and proportionate application). Overall, it was suggested that the level of detail of the guidelines be reduced. The principle of proportionality applies to the CRD, CRR and PSD and to all of the EBA guidelines. The guidelines provide further criteria for the application of this principle to ensure the consistent application of regulatory requirements. The guidelines specify the requirements set out under Level-1 text and therefore should clarify, with sufficient detail, how the requirements are to be applied in a consistent way. Please refer to the impact assessment included in this document. No specific change; the guidelines have been clarified where appropriate Cloud Some respondents expressed concerns regarding the general assumption of the guidelines that every cloud solution is considered as critical or important, rather than each being examined on a case-by-case basis. Cloud outsourcing follows the same assessment approach as other arrangements with service providers, taking into account cloud specificities. The guidelines have been clarified Brexit Some respondents requested more flexibility, in particular due to Brexit and the potential increase of third-country service providers. Please refer to the EBA opinion on issues related to the departure of the United Kingdom from the EU. The EBA is bound to apply and implement the applicable EU legislation, including with regard to third countries. No change 72 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals GDPR Some respondents suggested that the references to the GDPR be merged or reduced, or commented that the guidelines contained requirements related to data protection that were inconsistent or even conflicted with the GDPR. The EBA assessed the guidelines before the consultation and did not identify areas that would contradict the GDPR. The have\nclarified guidelines\nbeen Oversight of service providers A few respondents suggested that the EBA should work on a validation or certification framework for service providers, so that it would not be necessary for several institutions to perform individual assessments. Competent authorities and the EBA have no direct role in the oversight of service providers that do not fall within the scope of their action. There is no legal basis for introducing a certification for 'approved service providers'. One respondent asked for clarity over the role of the EBA and/or the relevant competent authority in the event of interruption of supply or supplier failure of a scheme provider or monopolistic supplier. The responsibility for the selection of the provider lies with the institution. When service providers fail, and this failure leads to a material impact on the institution or the stability of the financial markets, competent authorities will take appropriate supervisory measures. No change Cooperation agreements between supervisory authorities Respondents found the requirement that cooperation agreements (Memorandums of Understanding; MoUs) be signed in third countries too burdensome and a few suggested that other existing supervisory arrangements be considered that may facilitate cross-border supervision, including supervisory colleges and the idea that cooperation agreements may be informal. Cooperation agreements with authorities in third countries must be reliable and effective if functions are outsourced to an extent that would require authorisation or registration. Institutions need to be aware of such cooperation arrangements; therefore, only formal arrangements can be relied on. Competent authorities will be required to publish the existence of such arrangements. The guidelines have been revised and clarified A few respondents recognised the need for Member State competent authorities to effectively supervise third-country outsourcing arrangements of regulated entities, but suggested that the home supervisory authority should maintain and issue a list of countries to which outsourcing is appropriate, rather than leaving the responsibility with institutions. To ensure that existing outsourcing arrangements can be continued, the guidelines have been revised and transitional arrangements have been added. Where subsidiaries of EU institutions in a third country outsource functions to service providers in third countries to an extent that would require authorisation or registration, 73 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals One respondent asked for confirmation that the requirement for cooperation agreements applies only in the case of outsourcing from an EU entity to a third-country entity, to avoid the need for cooperation agreements between supervisory authorities of two third-country subsidiaries of an EU parent institution. cooperation agreements with the competent authority of the service provider are needed to ensure effective supervision on a consolidated basis. Mapping of requirements Some respondents suggested that the specific requirements for each type of outsourcing (i.e. general outsourcing, outsourcing of a critical or important function, intragroup arrangements) be clarified and that the requirements for each type be compiled in a specific table or diagram. The guidelines ensure that the scope of application of the requirements is sufficiently clear. No change Environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards A few respondents suggested that the ESG standards to which service providers must adhere be left to the discretion of the outsourcing institution. The guidelines refer to the code of conduct of the institution and to human rights; institutions need to comply with both, including if they have outsourced functions. No change Employee representation A few respondents suggested that these guidelines should require there to be a process for consulting employee representatives and that institutions should perform an impact assessment on the effects on the employees and discuss it with the social partners. Employee representation is set out under national laws. The CRD includes no mandate to harmonise the involvement of employee representatives. No change Consistency Some respondents observed that the terms 'electronic money institutions' and 'e-money institutions' were not consistently used. The consistency of and use of wording in the guidelines have been ensured. The guidelines have been reviewed Responses to questions in Consultation Paper EBA/CP/2018/11 Question 1 74 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals General comments on the scope and definitions Some respondents supported the idea of aligning the definition of outsourcing with the one in MiFID II; others suggested different, narrower, definitions. Several respondents pointed out that the scope of the guidelines was wider than that of MiFID II, as the strict limitation to critical and important functions and the explicit exclusion of certain functions (e.g. advisory service, (personnel) training, billing, premises services and the purchase of standardised services) in MiFID II were missing from the guidelines. In addition, respondents noted that the EBA guidelines broadened the application by including 'parts thereof' in addition to the process, service or activity, as well as by addressing all outsourcing arrangements (i.e. also non-critical or non- important arrangements). Some respondents requested that, for the sake of clarity, these guidelines be limited in a proportionate and risk-based manner to 'critical or important' outsourcing arrangements. Several respondents commented that the legal basis for including non- critical and non-important outsourcing arrangements was not clear. The MiFID II framework limits the requirements to critical or important functions; establishing additional requirements for all outsourcing arrangements can be achieved at the legislative level only. The EBA therefore would, through these guidelines, go beyond its powers by creating new law. The definition of outsourcing has been fully aligned with the definition in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/565 supplementing MiFID II. It would not be practical for institutions to apply different definitions for different activities (i.e. banking activities versus investment and payment services). It is the EBA's view that the definition applies also to parts of functions that are outsourced. Such parts of functions are themselves processes, services or activities that fall into the scope of the definition. The additional explanations have been moved into a different section to avoid any confusion with the definition of outsourcing. However, other non-material outsourcing arrangements should also be managed by institutions as part of their governance arrangements. Article 74 CRD includes a specific mandate for the EBA to develop guidelines on governance, including the operational structure of institutions. Outsourcing arrangements are part of institutions' operational structure. Similar governance requirements exist in the PSD2 and MiFID II. In addition, the EBA is mandated within Article 16 of its Founding Regulation (EU) 1093/2010 to provide guidelines within its scope of action. The EBA has reviewed the guidelines and introduced, taking into account the principle of proportionality, further simplifications for other (i.e. non-material) outsourcing arrangements. The definition has been revised and the guidelines have been clarified Application to specific firms (central counterparties (CCPs), central securities Some respondents requested that a clarification be given regarding whether CCPs or CSDs holding a banking licence and MLTFs operated by investment firms would need to comply with the EBA guidelines over and above existing sector-specific The guidelines set out how Articles 74 and 109 CRD and the requirements within the PSD2 are applied with regard to outsourcing functions. All institutions that are subject to those requirements are addressees of the guidelines. The guidelines have been clarified 75 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals depositories (CSDs) and multilateral trading facilities (MLTFs)) and critical infrastructures regulations. The respondents suggested that CCPs, CSDs and MLTFs be exempted from the scope of the guidelines, as otherwise this could lead to duplications or inconsistencies in the requirements. Other respondents suggested that the guidelines should apply to all service providers. Two respondents highlighted the specific position of financial market infrastructures (FMIs)/critical service providers (CSPs) and suggested that FMIs/CSPs should not be subject to the guidelines, as they are already adequately supervised or overseen by financial regulators. The guidelines cannot be addressed to service providers that are not directly subject to the underlying regulatory requirement. As regards the question of whether the service provided by a CCP or being a member of a MLTF is considered outsourcing, the guidelines have been clarified and, in general, this is not the case. The same applies to the provision of market infrastructures, even if they are considered critical. Third-country application A few respondents were concerned about the extraterritorial impact of the requirements and suggested that the competitive impact on entities located in, and outsourcing within, third- country jurisdictions be considered. The guidelines cannot deviate from Article 109 CRD, which prescribes how requirements should be applied on a prudential consolidated basis, including in third countries. No change Definition Obligations to outsource Some respondents stressed that services performed on the group level (e.g. a central unit) on a mandatory or optional basis should not be deemed as outsourcing. In some jurisdictions (e.g. Austria and Italy), the cooperative banks are required to outsource certain services or processes to the central body. The central performance of a function on the group level may well fall within the definition of outsourcing. In all cases, the risks have to be managed. It has been clarified in the guidelines how the requirements should be applied in a group and in an institutional protection scheme context. The guidelines have been amended and clarified Definition Examples Many respondents suggested that the non-exhaustive list of examples of arrangements that do not fall into the scope of outsourcing should be extended. The detailed arrangement has to be taken into account when assessing if an arrangement is considered an outsourcing arrangement. However, a few additional examples that are in general considered as purchasing have been added. Additional examples added 76 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals Definition IT outsourcing Particularly in the context of IT services, respondents commented that there are many services that, in a practical sense, would never be undertaken by an institution (e.g. as they have evolved recently, such as cloud services). Institutions need to take into account jointly all functions that are provided by a service provider when assessing if an arrangement falls under the definition of outsourcing (e.g. the provision of IT infrastructure together with data backup services). The guidelines have been clarified Therefore, respondents suggested that, where an IT service is not critical for the provision of continuous and satisfactory service to clients, it should not fall under the term 'otherwise be undertaken by the institution' under the term 'outsourcing'. Even if such an arrangement would not be considered as an outsourcing arrangement, e.g. as it would simply be the procurement of hardware or storage space, institutions must manage the risks resulting from such a third-party arrangement. Cloud outsourcing A respondent suggested that the guidelines be aligned more closely with the language of the EBA's recommendations on outsourcing to cloud service providers, so that institutions are assured that they can continue to follow the existing regime. The EBA in general retained the approach taken towards cloud outsourcing, but introduced a better differentiation between the requirements for critical and important outsourcing and non-material outsourcing, which also applied to cloud outsourcing arrangements. The guidelines have been clarified Some respondents requested that the approach towards cloud outsourcing be reviewed and that a more proportionate approach be taken; in particular, a differentiation between material and non-material outsourcing was suggested. In a few areas (e.g. audit rights and documentation), further clarifications have been necessary to ensure a more uniform application in line with supervisory expectations and the general outsourcing framework. Payment and electronic money institutions A few respondents urged the EBA to exclude payment and electronic money institutions from the scope of the guidelines (at least in their starting years) to promote start-ups. Two respondents suggested that these guidelines apply to payment and electronic money institutions only when they outsource an operational function, in particular providing that their service through an agent (distributor) is already sufficiently regulated. The guidelines allow for a proportionate application of the requirements. The proportionality criteria provided in the guidelines do not form an exhaustive list and payment institutions may use additional criteria. In addition, start-ups that are payment institutions or electronic money institutions have to comply with the regulatory requirements that form the basis of the guidelines. The guidelines have been clarified 77 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals Other respondents requested that there be a more proportionate approach for payment and electronic money institutions than for institutions subject to the CRD. The provisions within the guidelines already take into account the regulatory framework (PSD2/EMD2). Where necessary, the guidelines specify the requirements for specific types of firms. A few respondents highlighted that the PSD2 needs to be considered and specific chapters should be included to highlight the different requirements for the different types of institutions, which would be required to achieve a proportionate and risk- based approach and would be in line with recital 10 PSD2 and recital 4 EMD2. Due to the largely similar framework, it was not considered efficient to split the guidelines into a set of guidelines under the CRD and a set of guidelines under the PSD/EMD. Paragraph 5 A few respondents suggested that the scope of the guidelines be limited to critical/important outsourcing agreements, as otherwise financial institutions could be prevented from entering into a non-critical/non-important outsourcing agreement with a service provider unless a contractual right for the institution and its competent authorities to access and audit the service provider was granted. The guidelines have been reviewed, including the definition and criteria for assessing the criticality or importance of a function, and the supervisory expectations have clarified, better differentiating between the outsourcing of critical or important functions and other outsourcing arrangements. The guidelines have been revised A few respondents suggested that the definition of 'critical and important' be supported by additional, relevant, non-exhaustive examples of services that fall outside the definition. Paragraph 9 Application on the solo level for firms within the scope of prudential consolidation Several respondents noted that it should be explicitly stated that investment management companies, which are already authorised under the UCITS Directive or the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD), are not in the scope of application of the guidelines. In accordance with Article 109 CRD IV, firms subject to the UCITS Directive or the AIFMD are in the scope of prudential consolidation and therefore are covered by the application of the guidelines on a consolidated level, but not on an individual level. The guidelines have been clarified 78 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals Paragraphs 12 and 13 Nearly all of the respondents commented on the date of application and transitional arrangements and asked them to be postponed. Many also requested that the change of existing contracts not be required, as this would infringe the principle of legal certainty. The date of application has been changed to 30 September 2019 and the period for transitional arrangements has been prolonged. Where contracts have not been updated, additional supervisory scrutiny is needed to ensure that institutions have robust governance arrangements in place. In the case of outsourcing functions, which themselves require The guidelines\nhave been clarified and transitional arrangements Some respondents are concerned that they have to discontinue existing arrangements, as cooperation arrangements may not exist or cannot be negotiated. authorisation, to third countries, the requirement of cooperation agreements is needed to ensure that the institution can be effectively supervised, which is one requirement for the One respondent pointed out that EBA/REC/2017/03 requires authorisation of institutions. Institutions need to document all outsourcing arrangements and have a register of outsourcing arrangements, as set out in the guidelines. A register of outsourcing arrangements is needed to ensure the effective supervision of institutions and to be able to identify concentrations at certain service providers. The register has been simplified for non-critical arrangements. The EBA recommendation on outsourcing to cloud service providers is already applicable, i.e. the time frame cannot be adjusted. that contracts are documented in the register only if they are new or renewed and urged the EBA to align the guidelines with this approach. have been revised One respondent considered that two distinct implementation timelines for cloud and other outsourced services would be costly to implement and suggested that the implementation time frames be harmonised. Definition Critical or important function Several respondents asked for clarification about whether the term 'critical or important' should be considered as one category or as two different levels of importance. Respondents requested a non-exhaustive (negative) list of non-critical and non- important functions (e.g. market communications). The definition of the wording 'critical or important' is the same as that used under MiFID II, namely it is one category of outsourcing arrangements. The term 'critical function' used in the BRRD is a different concept and has a different definition under the BRRD framework. The guidelines have been clarified One respondent asked whether the term 'material' has been replaced entirely. The term 'material' used in previous CEBS guidelines have been replaced to ensure consistency with Level-1 requirements. 79 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals Respondents requested that the term 'critical function' be clarified, as it has a different meaning under various regulations (e.g. the BRRD). Some examples of non-critical and non-important functions (i.e. non-material functions) have been added. Definition Critical or important A few respondents suggested that any intragroup outsourcing within a national group or a group surprised by the single supervisory mechanism be expressly excluded from the definition of 'critical or important function', as these arrangements are less risky. The importance of outsourcing arrangements has to be assessed based on the criteria provided in the guidelines for both intragroup outsourcing and outsourcing outside the group. No change Definition Critical or important A few respondents requested that a reference to any operational task performed by the internal control functions be removed, as this would implicitly require that any internal control function tasks be considered as critical or important, which would not be true. The comment has been accommodated; however, where outsourcing of parts of control functions happen, this should be considered as critical or important if it can impair the proper functioning of institutions' internal control framework. The guidelines have been revised Definition Sub-outsourcing Some respondents requested further clarification regarding the definition of sub-outsourcing and suggested that sub- outsourcing be clarified as concerning only the service that was delegated and not the governance arrangements of the service provider or the infrastructures used by it. Some respondents suggested that any requirements regarding sub-service providers be deleted and that the institutions' responsibility be limited to their direct counterparties or at least that the requirements be limited to critical or important outsourcing arrangements. Other respondents requested that the definition be limited to services relevant for the outsourced function. The definition has been clarified. A situations is also considered sub-outsourcing where parts of the outsourced function are provided by a sub-service provider. The assessment follows the same pattern as the assessment of institutions' arrangements with third parties. Sub-outsourcing can change the risk and reliability of outsourcing arrangements. Therefore, the institutions must have a say and be aware of such arrangements, in particular regarding critical or important outsourcing arrangements, while the initial service provider also has monitoring obligations. The institution remains fully responsible for the function and compliance with regulatory requirements in the case of outsourcing and sub-outsourcing. The guidelines have been revised 80 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals Some respondents proposed that the guidelines should clearly state where multi-level sub-outsourcing is allowed and where it is limited to one level of sub-outsourcing. Sub-outsourcing along the chain of service providers is not limited, as long as the conditions of the guidelines and the contract between the institution and the service provider are met. Definition Service provider One respondent asked for clarification regarding whether a branch is considered a service provider when providing a service to another branch within the institution. Branches are non-independent parts of an institution and therefore services provided by a branch are not outsourcing. No change Definition Cloud Respondents, while pointing out that cloud outsourcing and the types of it are defined terms, urged the EBA to take a more technologically neutral approach so that the guidelines would be capable of including new or emerging IT services. A few respondents suggested that a lighter framework be created for outsourcing to 'multi-tenant service providers'. One respondent highlighted the need to take into account that many cloud products are characterised by being highly standardised services, which are offered to a broad range of customers and undertaken by monopolists (e.g. Microsoft, Oracle and SAP). Therefore, respondents argued that it should be acknowledged, as in the BaFin's MaRisk, that multi-tenant service providers of standardised IT services cannot comply with all regulatory requirements and a proportionate approach should be allowed (in particular regarding access and audit rights and the required minimum content of contractual arrangements). Respondents also noted that the guidelines' requirements relating to cloud services are generally ICT specific and therefore should not be included in an outsourcing contract solely on the basis that some components are in a cloud environment. The guidelines do not restrict or promote the outsourcing of certain IT structures or technologies. It was decided that the EBA recommendations on outsourcing to cloud service providers would be integrated into the general outsourcing framework. Institutions should comply with all regulatory requirements, including with regard to their outsourced functions, independent of the fact that they may be standardised or provided by monopolists. The named service providers are currently themselves not directly subject to the regulatory requirements set out in the CRD. The guidelines - in the same way as the cloud recommendation - already include simplifications, e.g. with regard to the performance of audits, that also apply to the outsourcing of functions to multi-tenant service providers. However, audit rights are a basis for effective oversight and supervision and so need to be ensured contractually for at least critical and important functions and on a risk-based approach, in particular as it is assumed that institutions will progressively use cloud and other IT solutions. The definition of cloud services does not state that all cloud services are also outsourcing arrangements. However, all risks of arrangements with third parties have to be managed. No change 81 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals Institutional protection schemes (IPSs) A few respondents suggested that a definition of an IPS be included, e.g. by referring to Article 113(7) CRR. The comment has been accommodated in a footnote. The has revised guideline been Question 2 General comment A few respondents requested that, throughout the guidelines, it should be spelled out how proportionality should be applied with regard to the specific provisions. The principle of proportionality needs to be applied based on sound judgement and considering the list of non-exhaustive criteria referred to in the guidelines. Providing detailed requirements for each and every situation would lead to an overly complex, prescriptive and inflexible framework. No change Proportionality Paragraph 15 Respondents welcomed the presence of the proportionality principle but asked the EBA to provide more clarity on the reference to the principle of proportionality, as they deemed the reference to the EBA internal governance guidelines to be insufficient, as the proportionality criteria included in these guidelines did not consider the complexity or scope of outsourcing arrangements. Some respondents suggested that outsourcing requirements should not be applied, based on proportionality considerations, to intragroup outsourcing or outsourcing to monopolists. In line with the CRD (e.g. recital 54 and Article 74), proportionality in the area of governance applies with regard to the nature, scale and complexity of the institution. The criteria set out in the EBA guidelines include the fact that the group structure should be taken into account. The guidelines on outsourcing further specify how the guidelines should be applied. Proportionality does not mean that requirements are not applied; instead it means that requirements are applied in a proportionate way. However, a differentiation between the requirements for critical or important functions and other functions has been made, where appropriate. No change Types of service providers Some respondents highlighted that there should be a clear distinction between regulated and unregulated service providers, as this would be in line with the principles underlying financial regulation. The outsourcing institution remains responsible for the outsourced functions, whether the service provider is supervised or not. This aspect will usually be relevant within the due diligence process. No change 82 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals Paragraphs 17 and 21 Respondents pointed out that the current wording of the guidelines implies that the guidelines have an extraterritorial application; respondents suggested that there should be a restriction of the scope to the authorised entities located in the EU. Other respondents suggested that the scope of application be limited to subsidiaries that are themselves subject to the CRD. A few respondents asked for further guidance on how this principle should be applied to the different risk models of AIF managers and UCITS managers. Respondents highlighted the importance of taking into consideration group recovery and resolution frameworks and the implementation of a proper exchange of information between EU competent authorities and resolution authorities to establish proportionality (in particular regarding Section 9.2, concentration risk in paragraph 59 and Section 12). See comments on Question 1, paragraph 9. In accordance with Article 109 CRD, the guidelines cannot deviate from those provisions. The guidelines apply to subsidiaries, including subsidiaries located in third countries that are not directly subject to the guidelines, but are covered by its requirements on a consolidated basis, i.e. considering that the parent and its subsidiary would form one single entity. The responsibility to implement the guidelines and to ensure compliance with the guidelines lies, in that situation, with the consolidating institution. The guidelines follow the approach set out within Articles 21 and 109 CRD. Therefore, they are applicable on a group level only, if the waivers have been granted. The CRD does not set out waivers in the area of internal governance or outsourcing for institutions that are affiliated to a central body. The guidelines set out how the provisions should be applied in this specific situation where a waiver has been granted under the CRD. The existence of recovery and resolution plans cannot lead to a waiver of requirements in a business-as-usual scenario. However, some elements of such plans, e.g. exit plans, may in some cases be sufficient for the purpose of the outsourcing guidelines. The guidelines have been clarified Paragraph 18 Some respondents claimed that this paragraph extends the scope of the guidelines beyond the intention of Article 109(2) CRD, as it requires a solo-level application of the guidelines and overwrites the sector-specific rules. All requirements of the CRD and PSD2 apply to institutions subject to those directives on a solo basis. Firms subject to the AIFMD and UCITS Directive need to comply on a solo basis with their own sectorial requirements. The guidelines have been clarified 83 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals Paragraphs 19 and 20 Groups and IPSs Several respondents commented that the proposed requirements on documentation, due diligence, concentration risk and exit strategy would be less relevant or even irrelevant from an intragroup or IPS perspective. The guidelines should recognise that the management of intragroup outsourcing should be proportionate to the risks presented by these arrangements. There should also be lower compliance and reporting obligations in these cases than for third-party outsourcing agreements. Various respondents stressed the importance of acknowledging that institutions that are part of certain financial structures (i.e. groups, IPSs and networks) do have to transfer tasks due to legal, regulatory or operational reasons or circumstances; such arrangements should not be considered as outsourcing. This would be particularly true in the case of small cooperative banks, which are either affiliated to a central body/institution in accordance with Article 10 or 113(7) CRR or embedded in a network. In particular, respondents noted that the services of clearing houses (within the framework of payment transactions and securities settlement), risk models, liquidity management and internal auditing performed by the parent undertaking or central institution should not be considered as outsourcing. Some suggested that the guidelines should better take into account the benefits of intragroup outsourcing, the degree of integration reached within many banking groups and the complementary measures and controls already required by other financial regulations such as the BRRD. For example, The guidelines are in line with the CRD provisions. They cannot introduce waivers that go beyond the Level-1 or -2 requirements. Institutions have to have robust governance arrangements in place on an individual basis. The management body of an institution always retains the final responsibility for the institution, including for the appropriate management of all risks. Intragroup outsourcing and IPS outsourcing can indeed be cost effective and efficient ways of receiving or sharing services. Intragroup/IPS outsourcing is not free from risks. The guidelines have been revised and clarified While a higher level of control needs to be taken into account, intragroup outsourcing must also be subject to appropriate decision-making processes. In addition, intragroup/IPS arrangements must be documented; this is obvious with regard to recovery and resolution planning requirements and is needed to ensure that institutions can be sure that such arrangements enable them to provide the services continuously to their customers. Potential conflicts of interests must be identified and managed; it cannot be per se assumed that intragroup outsourcing is free from such conflicts. Business continuity plans must cover the whole group of institutions or institutions within an IPS and must also be implemented and tested (e.g. by being involved in the central testing of arrangements) by single institutions within the group or IPS. The draft guidelines already included several alleviations for intragroup and IPS outsourcing, and these have been further 84 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals intragroup risk management, measurement, controls and internal governance should be recognised in the guidelines. Respondents also noted that the parent undertaking, as the superordinate entity, should implement risk management and control processes to ensure its responsibility for compliance with prudential requirements on a group level, which also eliminates conflicts of interest. Some respondents claimed that there is no need for a documented exit strategy for intragroup and IPS arrangements, as the plans and operational resilience measures cover the issues in such cases sufficiently. clarified. In particular, the requirements on exit strategies have been revised. Paragraph 19 BRRD Respondents urged the EBA to align the requirements with the provisions of the BRRD and highlighted that intragroup arrangements should not be subject to replacement tests for third-party outsourcing, but should be dealt with within the context of shared service agreements, global recovery and resolution plans. The guidelines should not ignore the requirements for resolution plans laid down in Section A of the Annex to the BRRD and the final regulatory technical standards on the content of these plans (e.g. Article 7 of the regulatory technical standards) and should recognise the approved plans. Respondents noted that competent authorities should coordinate with the relevant resolution authorities when applying these guidelines to avoid duplication of work and urged the EBA to implement cooperation and information sharing between competent authorities. The guidelines have been clarified. Where such plans include sufficient exit strategies from outsourcing arrangements, it is not necessary to define additional strategies for this purpose. However, it needs to be clarified that the BRRD requirements are tailored for a specific purpose that deviates from a business-as- usual scenario. Institutions should also consider in their operational risk and business continuity management that a failure of an internal service provider may have a material impact on their business activities. Section on exit strategies amended Paragraph 19 Respondents pointed out that the strict application of the guidelines in a group context could lead to situations where a Articles 74 and 109 CRD require that there are robust governance arrangements on the solo, sub-consolidated and No change 85 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals Group audit rights subsidiary obtains the right to audit or monitor its parent company. This would contradict the fact that the parent company has the duty of oversight over its affiliated entities. consolidated levels. This includes the fact that service providers can be audited, even if the service is provided by the parent institution in the way of a joint audit or outsourcing arrangement. Audit functions can be outsourced and the guidelines set out a range of audit mechanisms that can be used. Paragraph 19 Group outsourcing Respondents noted that the CEBS guidelines acknowledged that the level of influence reduced the overall risk of outsourcing and that the new guidelines should not lead to a discontinuity of intragroup arrangements, as this would cause a higher risk. In addition, respondents highlighted that outsourcing to the lead institution is a crucial part of the steering function in a group. The guidelines on outsourcing do not intend to restrict intragroup outsourcing, but specify the requirements that need to be fulfilled if functions are outsourced, including within groups. Indeed, within a group, the consolidating institution is responsible for implementing group-wide robust governance arrangements. However, this does not replace the responsibilities of individual institutions. No change Paragraph 19(b) and (c) Some respondents suggested that paragraph 19(b) should be clarified, as it could be interpreted that the group has to maintain individual registers for all institutions for the competent authorities. Some respondents suggested that IPSs should be mentioned in paragraph 19(b) (central keeping of the register) and 19(c) (central monitoring and audit functions) to ensure consistency with paragraph 46. Maintaining a register is the responsibility of the institution. Paragraph 19 has been clarified: the register and operational tasks of monitoring and audit functions can also be provided centrally within a group or an IPS. The guidelines have been amended Paragraph 20(a) Some respondents commented that the current advantages of intragroup outsourcing are removed by the guidelines due to the negation of the lower level of risk; they suggested that there was no need to retain adequate competence and sufficient skilled resources to ensure appropriate management and oversight of the outsourced tasks as long as the reporting and impact assessment were fulfilled. The guidelines do not restrict intragroup outsourcing. If there is, in the specific case in question, a lower level of risk, this will be taken into account in the risk assessment, even if it is performed centrally. However, institutions and members of the management body are responsible for ensuring robust governance arrangements and managing all risks. Without retaining sufficient competence No change 86 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals and resources, this responsibility cannot be executed. The responsibility cannot be delegated, as otherwise the condition of authorisation would no longer be fulfilled. Paragraph 20(b) Some respondents suggested that consistent terms be used for the 'pre-outsourcing analysis' throughout the guidelines and that the wording in the paragraph on 'pre-outsourcing assessment' be changed accordingly. The wording has been aligned throughout the guidelines. The guidelines have been revised Paragraph 21 Some respondents proposed that, for institutions organised in a financial network (within or outside an IPS), a similar centrally organised regime as for groups, where waivers have be granted, should be recognised. An IPS is required to prove that there is no current or foreseen material, practical or legal impediment to the immediate transfer of own funds or the repayment of liabilities from the counterparty to the institution. Furthermore, the IPS has to demonstrate that it has suitable and uniform stipulated systems in place to monitor and classify risks and the corresponding possibilities to take influence, providing a complete overview of the risk situations of all the individual members and the IPS as a whole. See comments on paragraphs 19 and 20. The waiver included in Article 21 CRD and Article 109(1) CRD in conjunction with Article 7 CRR are subject to approval by competent authorities, i.e. groups can benefit only if they meet the conditions and the waiver has been granted by the competent authority. They do not apply to an IPS. The guidelines are in line with the CRD provisions, but cannot introduce waivers that go beyond the Level-1 or -2 requirements. Institutions, even if they are part of a financial network or IPS, have to have robust governance arrangements on an individual basis. No change Question 3 General comments While some respondents were content with the approach taken and appreciated that the institution can apply some judgement, others stated that they would prefer it if more guidance and clear examples were provided. Some respondents provided examples of arrangements that should always be considered or should never be considered as outsourcing arrangements. The guidelines set out the principles and criteria to be applied by institutions when assessing arrangements with third parties. In most cases and within a concise document, it would not be possible to clearly define examples that, in each situation, would lead to the same assessment results. However, a few more obvious examples have been added. The guidelines have been revised and clarified 87 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals Paragraph 22 Criteria to identify outsourcing arrangements Some respondents stressed that the scope of outsourcing arrangements is further expanded due to the provision stipulating that, for the determination of outsourcing, it does not matter whether the specific institution is or will be able to perform the function itself or not. In some structures, the central institution or specialised entity is set up with the purpose of performing standardised services for the affiliated institutions that would not be able to undertake those services by themselves (due to small banks' lack of ability to bear the costs or to reach the level of quality safeguarded by those specialised entities). By considering it irrelevant whether an institution has performed that function in the past or would be able to perform it by itself, the number of contracts falling within the scope would increase significantly. Some respondents highlighted the need to include an element of time (duration or continuing) in the definition of 'outsourcing'. When a function is normally performed by institutions in general and is provided by a service provider, the arrangement should usually be qualified as outsourcing, even if the individual institution has not performed it itself or would also not be able to perform it. An element of time duration has been added to the guidelines: outsourcing arrangements should be recurrent or ongoing services. The guidelines have been clarified Paragraphs 22 and 23 Several respondents urged the EBA to include a clear distinction between purchasing and outsourcing, while taking future technological developments into account. The guidelines, via the definition of outsourcing, provide a clear set of criteria that should be used to determine outsourcing arrangements. The criteria have been further specified. However, even if something is purchased, institutions are responsible for managing the risks that may result from this arrangement. This is independent from future developments. The guidelines have been clarified Paragraphs 22 and 23 Some respondents sought clarifications about whether the purchase of standardised/licensed software of services that support IT platforms (e.g. web hosting, distributed denial-of- The guidelines have been amended to take into account the concept of non-recurrent activities. Purchases of goods The guidelines have been amended 88 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals service (DDoS) systems, data back-up processes) are considered as outsourcing or purchasing. Furthermore, confirmation was requested of the fact that such agreements would not be considered as critical or important (e.g. the failure of a DDoS protection system causing the payment institution's website to break down). Some respondents considered that services that are performed by all entities and are usually obtained from third parties or are not related to a licensed core banking activity or risk management are not 'normally performed by an institution' (e.g. bookkeeping, tax advice and tax compliance services, statutory reporting/accounting, custody audits, human resources, payroll accounting, purchasing computers, infrastructure, tenant-like electricity or other connections). Supporting tasks such as administrative or technical functions, e.g. logistical support in the form of cleaning, catering and procurement of basic services or products, should also not be deemed as outsourcing. (including software licences) are not considered as outsourcing arrangements. Additional examples of purchasing have been added. However, institutions have to manage all of their risks when entering into an arrangement with third parties, including the operational risk of inappropriate or failing IT systems (soft- and hardware), and have to take appropriate business continuity measures. Paragraph 24 Some respondents requested that paragraph 24 be deleted, as it would go beyond the scope of the guidelines (in particular for intragroup/IPS internal purchasing). The requirement to perform a risk assessment or due diligence (in accordance with Sections 9.3 and 9.4) for all third-party arrangements is excessive and cannot be mitigated solely by applying the principle of proportionality. The approach is maintained, but a closer link to the internal governance guidelines has been made within the guidelines; the link with the application of the proportionality principle is also further stressed. The guidelines have been clarified Paragraph 24 A few respondents considered that service providers would no longer be able to perform parts of licenced tasks on behalf of institutions without obtaining a licence, which is required for many financial technologies that use 'white label banking' (i.e. It is not always the case that part of a licensed activity would require a licence. Authorisation requirements are set out within the CRD and PSD2. Whenever one of the activities that requires licensing is The guidelines have been clarified 89 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals an outsourcing arrangement with an institution to deliver its services). performed, authorisation or registration is required in line with the applicable national law. Paragraph 25 One respondent requested a clarification on the sufficient steps an institution should take to verify whether a service provider in a different Member State is required to be authorised or registered and whether it fulfils the requirements. Whenever institutions outsource functions to an extent that requires authorisation or registration, the function can only be outsourced to a service provider that is authorised or registered or otherwise allowed to perform the function within a Member State. The wording has been clarified. Additional requirements apply if the service provider is located in a third country. The guidelines have been clarified A few respondents asked for confirmation that payment institutions may involve service providers in offering regulated services through a system of chain outsourcing that includes non-regulated entities. Some respondents suggested that intragroup outsourcing be excluded from paragraphs 25 and 26. Where functions do not require licensing, they can be provided by any suitable service provider. However, it must be ensured that the conditions of the institutions' authorisation are respected. This also holds true in the case of sub-outsourcing. Institutions have to include appropriate checks within their due diligence process to determine if the service provider has an authorisation or is registered. The same principle also applies with regard to outsourcing within the group. Paragraph 26 Respondents requested a clarification on who will assess and how institutions should assess if a service provider is 'sufficiently supervised' and what will be the consequence if such arrangements do not meet the supervisory expectations. In the first place, it is the institution's responsibility to ensure compliance with all regulatory requirements. Competent authorities will take appropriate measures if needed, including if they cannot supervise institutions effectively. No change Paragraph 26 A few respondents pointed out that problems occur especially in situations where a service provider is located in another state (a Member State or third country), in particular with regard to data protection requirements and the exchange of information under cooperation agreements. Data protection regulations have to be complied with. Cooperation agreements require that third-country authorities apply equivalent confidentiality and data protection requirements. The guidelines have been clarified with regard to the forms of supervisory cooperation agreements expected. The guidelines have been clarified and amended 90 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals While respondents agreed on the fact that the home supervisors need to be able to supervise the outsourcing institution, those respondents complained that the guidelines restrict paragraph 26(b) only to a MoU. Some requested that existing arrangements between the authorities or the cases in which a service is outsourced but no MoU is yet in place be taken into account. Transitional arrangements for the existence of cooperation agreements have been introduced. Cooperation agreements are required only for functions that are outsourced to an extent that would require authorisation or registration if the service provider were located within a Member State. Paragraph 26 Some respondents stressed that competent authorities should be required to publish on their website which cooperation agreements are in line with the requirements (paragraph 26(c)). Competent authorities will be required to publish the existence of cooperation agreements (MoUs). The guidelines have been amended Paragraph 27 A few respondents commented that, if a function has not been performed by the institution in the past, it cannot meet the requirement of retaining the ability to reintegrate the function or transfer it to another provider within an appropriate time frame. If a new activity is going to be performed via an outsourcing arrangement, the institution must be able to oversee the activity or to integrate, transfer or end it within an appropriate time frame. New activities, even if performed by service providers, are also relevant for the ongoing assessment of the suitability of members of the management body and key function holders. The wording has been clarified. The guidelines have been clarified Paragraph 28 A few respondents suggested that the management body involvement be kept at a high level, i.e. the management body would participate in the definition and approval of the high-level outsourcing policy and in the reporting of material risks. The involvement of the management body is defined within the CRD and PSD2 and for institutions in the EBA Guidelines on internal governance. The guidelines on outsourcing are consistent with those requirements. No change Question 4 General comments Many respondents found the requirements on outsourcing policy to be too specific and suggested that more freedom be given to institutions for developing an outsourcing policy document. The guidelines have been revised to focus more on the outsourcing of critical and important functions. However, institutions need to manage all outsourcing arrangements. The guidelines have been revised 91 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals Some respondents suggested that the policy should focus more on the outsourcing of functions that are critical and important. Some respondents found the conflict of interest requirements (in particular in group situations) to be not sufficiently clear (e.g. 'material conflict'). A few respondents suggested that the economic aspect (e.g. cost-effectiveness, reduction of risks) be taken into account by including provisions regarding a cost-benefit analysis. One respondent requested a clarification on whether the term 'policy' refers to a physical document or to frameworks and standards (i.e. a broader definition). Conflicts of interest (see also the EBA Guidelines on internal governance) need to be identified and managed. They can occur at different levels, e.g. group entities, business lines or economic interests of members of the management body or staff. Institutions should also take into account their business needs and the costs and benefits of outsourcing arrangements. However, the present guidelines focus on the prudential aspects of outsourcing arrangements. The term 'policy' is based on substance rather than form; it does not matter if there is one document or if overall appropriate policies are in place. Institutions as service providers Some respondents highlighted that these guidelines do not address the specific case whereby the institution is the service provider and urged the EBA to provide guidance for it. The guidelines deal with outsourcing by institutions. Institutions can also be service providers and, in this role, are required to comply with all regulatory and contractual obligations. No change Outsourcing policies for payment and electronic money institutions One respondent noted that Articles 19 and 20 PSD2 and the EBA Guidelines on the security measures for operational and security risks of payment services under the PSD2 already provide sufficient requirements regarding payment and electronic money institutions. The guidelines are in line with Articles 19 and 20 PSD2 and set out further guidance on the supervisory expectations of outsourcing arrangements. No change Paragraph 28 One respondent asked who is considered the responsible 'management body' (e.g. for resolving conflict of interests) in the case of multiple group members using the same intragroup service provider. Each institution is responsible for the management of its outsourcing arrangements and conflicts of interest, even if some operational tasks are performed centrally. On a consolidated level, this responsibility is with the EU parent institution. No change 92 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals Paragraph 28(e) A few respondents commented that day-to-day management is, by definition, a senior management task and not the\nresponsibility of the management body. The comment has been accommodated. The\nhave\namended guidelines\nbeen Paragraph 30 Some respondents considered that establishing a new function or key function holder would involve significant effort and be a burden (in terms of cost and time) and suggested that, instead, this responsibility should be left to the institution. Some suggested deleting this requirement completely. Respondents requested that the principle of proportionality be applied and that a member of the management body (especially in smaller or non-credit institutions, e.g. payment institutions) be allowed to be the responsible person. Furthermore, respondents highlighted that outsourcing rules should be in line with institutions' three line of defence approach. The guidelines require that at least one person should be responsible for managing outsourcing arrangements or for establishing a function. This will depend on the size of the institution and the number and materiality of outsourcing arrangements. It is not a requirement that this person does not have other functions, as long as those functions do not conflict with the person's role as 'outsourcing officer'. It is indeed possible to assign the responsibility to a member of the management body. The\nhave\nclarified guidelines\nbeen Indeed, the management of outsourcing arrangements should follow the three lines of defence approach, including, first, monitoring by the business, control by the second line of defence and, third, the audit. Paragraph 31(c) A few respondents requested that the term 'operational' and the examples in brackets be deleted due to their implication of limiting the outsourcing, e.g. for the risk control function to operational tasks and to group structures. The term 'operational' is intended to clarify that the responsibility for that function cannot be outsourced. It is possible to outsource tasks of internal control functions under the conditions set out in the guidelines. The\nhave\nclarified guidelines\nbeen Paragraph 32(e) Respondents requested that the term 'fintech' be deleted as it is already included in the term 'ICT', unless there are specific risks (then clarification would be required). 'Fintech' is a commonly used term that is also used in other EBA products; it is included in the term 'ICT'. The\nhave clarified guidelines\nbeen 93 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals Paragraph 32(g) Respondents pointed out that paragraph 32(g), in combination with paragraphs 89-91, requires that an alternative service provider or the ability to reintegrate a critical or important function is needed to ensure comprehensive, documented and sufficiently tested exit plans; however, it is not always possible to meet these provisions. In addition, for critical or important functions, an exit strategy should not be required. Respondents highlighted that, in general, the guidelines should provide more clarity on what an 'appropriate time frame' would be. One respondent requested clarification on whether the reference to 'going concern' relates to situations where a supplier fails. While the requirements of exit strategies have been revised, institutions must be able to ensure the continuity of the business activities or at least be able to end activities if a service provider cannot be replaced, the service cannot be provided internally or the continuity of the function cannot be ensured otherwise. The EBA refrained from providing an exact time frame, as this will depend on the impact of a potential disruption and the complexity of the outsourcing arrangement. 'Going concern' was added to differentiate the situation from a resolution scenario, but has been deleted as this may still be relevant under resolution scenarios, where the continuity of services is desired. The guidelines have been amended Paragraph 32(h) Respondents pointed out that compliance with the GDPR is already stipulated by the GDPR itself and is subject to supervision by data protection authorities. References to the GDPR have been centralised in the document, but were retained in the document for the sake of clarity. The guidelines have been amended Paragraph 33 A few respondents suggested that the guidelines should be restricted to consolidated entities to which the statutory outsourcing provisions are applicable. One respondent asked whether the application of the guidelines on the sub-consolidated level and on a consolidated basis is restricted to licensed entities established in the EU and to whom the statutory outsourcing provisions apply. The guidelines follow the approach under Article 109 CRD. Institutions need to ensure that policies are implemented on a consolidated basis (prudential scope of consolidation). This consequently means that group policies should also apply to subsidiaries that individually are not subject to the CRD, including institutions located in third countries. No change 94 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals Paragraph 34(b)(v) One respondent stressed that this requirement is burdensome if any minor conflict of interest with third parties has to be identified. The policy should detail the approach towards the management of conflicts of interests, including their identification. No change Paragraph 34(c)(ii) Some respondents considered that this requirement was too detailed for a policy noted that clarification is needed regarding the fact that changes should be communicated only where they will have a relevant impact on the outsourcing arrangement. The policy should detail the approach towards any changes related to the relationship that may have an impact on the institution. The policy should be established, taking into account the proportionality principle. No change Paragraph 34(e) Respondents asked for clarification on the limitation to critical or important outsourcing arrangements (at least for paragraph (i)) and on the required measures an institution should have in place to prepare for a possible exit (e.g. should an agreement with alternative providers already be in place?). The guidelines have been revised to focus more on the outsourcing of critical or important functions. Indeed, the guidelines explicitly mention that the policy should differentiate between outsourced critical or important functions and other outsourcing arrangements. The guidelines have been amended Paragraph 34(e) Respondents stressed that it would not be proportionate to require small savings and cooperative banks or subsidiaries within a group to implement exit strategies for critical or important functions such as IT systems. The service providers of such structures are often owned by the cooperative network or group. See comments regarding the group/IPS context. The guidelines have been amended Paragraph 35 Respondents asked for there to be a clear distinction between the various types of outsourcing and their different treatments, otherwise there would not be any bases for a distinct approach in internal policies. The guidelines have been revised to focus more on the outsourcing of critical or important functions. Indeed, the guidelines explicitly mention that the policy should differentiate between outsourced critical or important functions and other outsourcing arrangements. No change 95 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals Paragraph 35(c) Respondents stressed that an IPS's ownership structure might differ from that of a consolidated group, in accordance with Article 11 CRR; therefore, there should be a clarification that other entities affiliated with the corresponding financial network should be covered, as should outsourcing arrangements between the member institutions; more detail should also be given on the less restrictive provision regarding intra group/IPS/network outsourcing. See comments regarding the group/IPS context. The guidelines have been clarified Paragraph 35(d) Respondents suggested that a proportionate approach would exclude sub-service providers or would at least limit the requirements for critical or important functions or for cases where data are stored outside the EEA. Sub-outsourcing has not been excluded, as it has an impact on risks and the monitoring of arrangements. The guidelines have been revised to focus more on the outsourcing of critical or important functions. The guidelines have been clarified Question 5 General comments Some respondents considered that Section 5 should be clarified with respect to intragroup/affiliate outsourcing arrangements and how competent authorities should supervise it. A few respondents considered that the section on the internal audit function should be applied by the institutions on a risk- based approach. Some respondents highlighted that service providers, in particular multi-tenant service providers, often refuse access to their internal control files and findings, regulatory reports or intrusion tests due to confidentiality reasons. One respondent stressed that the PSD2 framework did not require any specific conflict of interest requirements. The guidelines have been clarified regarding the group/IPS context. The internal audit function, in line with the guidelines and the guidelines on internal governance, should be applied on a risk- based approach. Institutions must comply with all regulatory requirements, including with regard to their outsourced functions, independent of whether or not the service provider is operating in a multi-tenant environment. Audit rights are a basis for effective oversight and supervision and need to be ensured contractually, in particular for the outsourcing of critical or important functions. The guidelines have been clarified 96 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals A few respondents pointed out that the guidelines would need to take into account the fact that institutions can also act as service providers. Therefore, the different natures of the counterparties needed to be taken into account and the EBA should allow a different approach. The PSD2 requires payment institutions to have robust governance arrangements. Institutions remain fully responsible in the case of outsourcing and it does not really matter if the service provider is an institution or not: the same requirements apply. This aspect can be taken into account in the due diligence process. Paragraph 37 Some respondents stressed that the assessment of conflicts of interest should be limited to critical or important services and that there were no (or very limited) conflicts of interest in the context of intragroup arrangements. Conflicts of interest (see also the EBA Guidelines on internal governance) need to be identified and managed. They can occur at different levels, e.g. group entities, business lines or because of other economic interests of members of the management body or staff. The guidelines ave been clarified Paragraph 38 Some respondents asked for clarification of what is considered a 'material conflict of interest' and a 'sufficient level of objectivity' for the purpose of this paragraph. Some respondents stressed that, in the case of group/IPS/cooperative structures, the principle of 'arm's length' cannot apply, as the strategic decisions take into account all parties interests causing no negative influences for anyone. See comments on paragraph 37. It is the responsibility of institutions to assess their materiality and decide on and implement, as appropriate, mitigating measures. Imposing arm's length conditions is one measure to avoid conflicts of interest, also considering possible recovery and resolution scenarios. However, synergies within groups or an IPS context may be considered. The guidelines have been clarified Paragraph 39 Several respondents suggested that the institution and the service provider do not have to provide different business continuity plans; e.g. in the case of outsourcing to a data centre, it should be sufficient that the service provider establishes a business continuity plan that would then also be accepted by the bank. The institution remains responsible in the case of outsourcing for its continuous operation; it should have a business continuity plan and it should ensure that this plan can be effectively implemented. No change 97 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals Paragraph 40 A few respondents sought clarification of the term 'severe business disruption'. One respondent asked for criteria to be given to assess 'disaster recovery' and asked for clarification on how this differs from a business continuity plan. Some respondents suggested that backup testing should be required only when it is appropriate, as some providers do not have backup facilities and instead store data on active servers. Therefore, it should be availability that is ensured, not the testing of backup facilities. A few respondents asked for clarification on the use of the term 'periodically' and suggested that periodical testing not be required, as the costs are very high. This section has been clarified and amended to accommodate the comments and to refer to the guidelines on internal governance. The guidelines have been clarified Paragraph 41 Some respondents asked if it is necessary for institutions to already have a contract with another service provider on hold for all critical or important outsourced functions or if such a contract should be on hold only for the functions bearing extraordinarily high risks, or alternatively if a risk-based assessment with documented contingency plans would be sufficient. Some respondents asked for clarification regarding the application of a business continuity plan on chains of outsourcing and asked about a risk-based approach. Business continuity plans should take into account the possibility that the quality of the provision of the outsourced critical or important function will deteriorate to an unacceptable level or fails. Such plans should also take into account the potential impact of the insolvency, or other failures, of service providers and, where relevant, political risks in the service provider's jurisdiction. The guidelines do not require institutions to already have contractual arrangements with alternative providers. The guidelines have been clarified Paragraph 42 Some respondents considered that the review of outsourced activities (including on-site visits) performed under audit rights should not be limited to the internal audit function but should be set on an instructional level, allowing specialised (second or third line of defence) functions (e.g. IT, legal, compliance, etc.), The management of outsourcing arrangements should follow the three lines of defence approach, including monitoring by the business, control by the second line of defence and audit. The guidelines have been clarified 98 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals outsourced specialists (e.g. third-party certifications, external auditors, etc.) or a combination of the above to undertake them on a risk-based approach. The third line of defence should, on a risk-based approach, visit critical or important service providers, ensuring in particular that the guidelines' provisions are met; this is currently the responsibility of a mix of all three lines of defence. Some respondents stressed that there should be a reference to pooled audits and third-party certificates in this section (with a reference to paragraphs 74 and 75) and that many service providers do have an internal audit function; therefore, it should be clarified that their assessment and outcomes may be used (in particular if the service provider is an institution). One respondent was of the view that payment and electronic money institutions should not be required to have an internal audit function. The guidelines focus on the third line, as it is the one usually in charge of audit. This is independent of ongoing monitoring activities that are also required. The guidelines specify that the internal audit function should perform its tasks taking into account a risk-based approach. Even if service providers do have an internal audit function, institutions cannot exclusively rely on it on an ongoing basis, at least for critical or important functions. Institutions are the ones subject to the regulatory requirements (see the section on audit rights). Payment and electronic money institutions should have sound governance arrangements, taking into account the application of proportionality. Paragraph 43 Many respondents considered that full audit rights are necessary only in the case of critical or important outsourcing, as negotiating those rights in all contracts (especially with third- country suppliers) would be burdensome. Many respondents sought clarification on how audit rights may effectively be enforced if the contractual rights are denied by predominant providers. Therefore, it was suggested that standardised reports (e.g. ISAE 34.02) be accepted for meeting the requirements of paragraphs 43 and 74. The guidelines have been amended to accommodate the comments. Audit rights are needed for at least critical or important functions, otherwise institutions would no longer have robust governance arrangements in place. See new Section 13.3 on audit and access rights. The guidelines have been revised to allow for a more principle- based and proportionate approach. Institutions should also refer to the EBA's internal governance guidelines. The guidelines have been clarified 99 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals Paragraph 44(d) Several respondents suggested that the specific reference to the service provider's risk appetite, risk management and control procedure in relation to the outsourced function be deleted. The risk appetite of a service provider will differ from that of an institution (or it will not have one). The guidelines have been revised. Implementing outsourcing arrangements should be conducted in line with the risk management framework of the institution and its risk appetite and strategy. Internal audit should ensure correct\nimplementation. The\nhave\nrevised guidelines\nbeen Question 6 General comments Some respondents asked whether or not the register could be sourced from various data components or if it has to be a stand- alone data repository. One respondent stressed that Annex X is far too detailed. Some respondents suggested that a centralised register for cooperative networks without an IPS should be allowed and that the guidelines should clearly mention that the maintenance of the register could be outsourced. It does not matter whether the register is sourced from various data components or if it is a stand-alone data repository, as longs as the information can be provided timely to the competent authority on request. However, to make it more effective and to ease the process, one single repository or the submission of one file to the competent authority would be more practical. Annex X has been deleted. The possibility of having a centralised register within groups or cooperative networks/IPSs has been included in the guidelines. See comments on groups/IPSs. Confidentiality should be ensured by institutions. Competent authorities are subject to professional secrecy obligations. The information required for the register has been reduced and the focus is now more on the outsourcing of critical or important functions. The guidelines have been revised Some respondents sought clarification regarding the purpose of the register and how the competent authorities will utilise the gathered information. A few respondents asked for guarantees to be included in the guidelines about any commercially confidential information that may be contained within the register, as very sensitive matters are covered. It was suggested that the register should be internal and access to it should be limited. Some respondents pointed out that it would be impossible to provide all of the information on a sub-outsourcing provider and that proportionality should be applied. 100 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals Paragraph 46 Most of the respondents asked for the register to be limited to critical or important outsourcing arrangements. In particular, respondents argued that the burden is very high for including unimportant peripheral and substitutable services, compared with their low-risk impact. In the case that all arrangements remain within the scope, some respondents suggested that the information regarding non- critical outsourcing arrangements be limited to a brief definition of the outsourced function and the name of the service provider. The information to be provided in the register has been reduced for non-material outsourcing. The guidelines have been revised Paragraph 47(a) A few respondents suggested that the meaning of 'prudential consolidation' be clarified. Prudential consolidation means the application of the prudential rules set out in the CRD and CRR on a consolidated or sub- consolidated basis, in accordance with Part 1, Title 2, Chapter 2 of the CRR. Prudential consolidation includes all subsidiaries that are institutions or financial institutions, as defined in Article 4(3) and (26) CRR, respectively, and may also include ancillary service undertakings, as defined in Article 2(18) CRR, established in and outside the EU. No change Paragraph 47(b) A few respondents stressed that providing the legal entity identifier or registration number, parent companies and address are not necessary. A few respondents suggested that paragraph (b)(vi) be deleted, as the data are already required under the GDPR. The comment has partly been accommodated. The information is needed for the register for the purpose of prudential supervision, so no change has been made in that respect. The guidelines have been revised Paragraph 47(c) Several respondents suggested that the reference to cloud outsourcing be deleted, as this is against the principle of technology neutrality and would result in unequal treatment between cloud solutions and other outsourcing. Therefore, The approach to cloud outsourcing has been revised and, for this specific form of outsourcing, an assessment of the criticality or importance is required. The guidelines have been revised 101 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals cloud outsourcing should be considered as critical or important if it is assessed as such in accordance with Section 9.1. Some respondents were of the view that the term 'at least' should be deleted to allow for proportionality. Some respondents pointed out that some information (e.g. costs) should not be mandatory, as they are available only on an aggregated basis. The use of the term 'at least' allows there to be a minimum list of information that institutions should include in the register. This allows for a level playing field among institutions when they are establishing the register and fosters sufficiently supervisory convergence, while allowing institutions to add additional information for their own purposes. The costs should be available and the guidelines specify that they should only be an estimate. Paragraph 47(c)(i) One respondent deemed that the summary of the risk analysis should not be included in the register, as this would already be documented in the assessment of the criticality of the function. If the information is already covered by the summary of the criticality assessment documented in the register then institutions may refer to that information. No change Paragraph 47(c)(v) Some respondents suggested that these data fields be deleted, as the audit schedule is part of the internal audit documentation. This information should be mentioned in the register. No change Paragraph 47(c)(vi) Some respondents highlighted that this should not apply in a group context and therefore the term 'where applicable' should be added. This also applies in a group/IPS context and therefore the information on substitutability should be provided. The guidelines have been clarified Paragraph 47(c)(ix) Some respondents asked for the word 'location' to be replaced by 'country or countries' due to the security risks of disclosing the location of the data centre. The comment has been accommodated; however, if the competent authorities requires more detailed information, e.g. to prepare an audit, more detailed information needs to be provided. The guidelines have been clarified Question 7 General comments Several respondents stressed that there are too many criteria for the assessment of the criticality or importance of a function and that several of them are part of the risk assessment. A non- The guidelines are consistent with the requirements set out in the existing regulation and outline the requirements with sufficient detail to ensure their application in a consistent way. The guidelines have been clarified 102 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals exhaustive list of critical or important services should be provided. Some respondents suggested that it be clarified whether each outsourcing arrangement has to be assessed on the solo and group levels. As soon as an outsourcing arrangement is deemed to be critical or important on any level, it should be treated as such, at least at the level concerned. The criticality should be assessed on an individual level regarding the institution making use of the arrangement. For institutions that are part of a group or make use of intragroup outsourcing arrangements, the impact of criticality should also be assessed on a consolidated basis in line with Article 109 CRD. Title IV - Outsourcing process Paragraph 48(f) Some respondents suggested that the expectations with regard to the pre-outsourcing analysis be clarified when the service provider is part of the accounting consolidated group. Institutions should consider whether the service provider is a subsidiary or a parent undertaking of the institution, is included in the scope of accounting consolidation or is a member of or owned by institutions that are members of an IPS and, if so, the extent to which the institution controls it or has the ability to influence its actions in line with Section 2 of the guidelines. This section has been clarified and part of it has been moved to the risk assessment section. The guidelines have clarified Paragraph 49(b) Some respondents stressed that the draft guidelines deviate from the requirements laid down in MiFID II and Article 30 of Commission Delegated Regulation 2017/565, as they consider any (full or in part) outsourcing of internal control functions as critical or important, whereas the MiFID II framework allows for a case-by-case assessment. The comment has been accommodated; however, where there is outsourcing of material parts of control functions that could impair their proper functioning, this should be considered as critical or important, as such functions are key elements of institutions' internal control framework. The guidelines have been clarified Paragraph 49(c) One respondent proposed that a definition of 'banking and payment services' be included, as it is not clear which services are addressed. A reference to Annex I of the CRD has been included. The guidelines have been clarified 103 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals Paragraph 50 Some respondents proposed that the paragraph be removed because not all cases of the outsourcing of activities, processes or services (e.g. some minor support functions) should be considered as critical or important, even if they relate to core business lines and critical functions. To limit the scope, the guidelines have been amended to further clarify that the outsourcing of functions directly connected to core business lines and critical functions should be considered as critical or important, unless the institution's assessment establishes that a failure to provide the outsourced function or inappropriate provision of the outsourced function would not have an adverse impact on the operational continuity of the core business line or critical function. The guidelines have been clarified Paragraph 51 Some respondents considered that paragraph 51 should be moved to Section 9.3, as this paragraph is about risk assessment. Several respondents highlighted that the list should not be exhaustive and that the interaction between paragraphs 49 and 51 should be clarified (both list similar criteria, but paragraph 49 includes classification as critical or important as mandatory). Several respondents pointed out that these criteria do not take into account the specificities of group structures. The guidelines have been clarified in line with the Commission Delegated Regulation under MiFID II, which defines the notion of critical or important functions for the purpose of outsourcing. To ensure consistent application, the guidelines provide additional criteria for the assessment of whether a function is critical or important. The guidelines have been clarified Some respondents considered that a clarification was needed on how these requirements interacted with paragraphs 49 and 50. It was assumed that these were additional conditions to those in the other paragraphs. However, it was proposed that they be merged. A few respondents considered that the meaning of the term 'conduct' in paragraph 51(b)(iii) should be clarified (as it could related to customers, capital markets or employees, or others). See comment on groups/IPSs. Conduct risk is a subcategory of operational risk and indeed refers to the conduct of institutions, including towards customers. 104 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals Paragraph 51(a) Some respondents suggested that the wording 'directly linked' be changed to 'directly connected' to reduce the scope. One respondent suggested that additional criteria for payment and electronic money institutions not be included, as Article 19(2) PSD2 already provides sufficient criteria. In particular, the requirements of paragraph 51(b)(i) would not allow a proportionate approach. The comment has been accommodated. Institutions, when assessing whether or not an outsourcing arrangement is critical or important, i.e. whether it concerns a critical or important function, should take into account the criteria, meaning that the application of the principle of proportionality is also considered. The guidelines have been amended Paragraph 51(e) Some respondents pointed out that this criterion should not apply on a group level, because it would lead to a situation in which several small outsourcing arrangements that were all non- critical or non-important for each group member were considered on aggregated bases. Institutions are required to manage their risks also on a consolidated basis. This criterion should be applied on both the individual and the group levels. No change Paragraph 51(g) A few respondents suggested that it be clarified that the assessment of scalability should focus on unexpected changes to the contract, which may result in a significant risk increase in connection with the outsourcing arrangement. The scalability is linked to the fact that an outsourcing agreement might become critical or important over time. No change Paragraph 52 A few respondents suggested that this paragraph be deleted because the paragraph 51 would already sufficiently address the required quantification; respondents also commented that substitutability is not a relevant factor for the assessment of criticality. The guidelines have been clarified and this paragraph has been deleted. Further guidelines have been included in the section on exit strategies. The guidelines have been amended Question 8 105 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals General comments Many respondents asked for clarification on whether or not the due diligence process applies to all outsourcing arrangements or only to the critical or important arrangements. Some respondents highlighted that there is not always a need for a due diligence process, or at least not on an individual basis for all institutions. It was suggested that the competent authorities perform this task by supervising the service providers or issuing quality labels or certifications. Another suggestion was that the EBA issue certification schemes in line with the Commission Working Group on cloud security certification schemes. Some respondents pointed out that the due diligence process, or at least some criteria of it, would not be necessary for intragroup outsourcing, as it would be redundant when adequate governance was set up and would sometimes be dependent on the outsourcing arrangement itself, such as the service provider's business model, nature, scale, complexity and financial situation. Particularly in the case of an IPS or a cooperative network, it would simply be a formal process, as the centralised entities are set up for the main purpose of providing the specific services and therefore the ability, capacity, resources and organisational structure are tailored to the needs and features of the members. Therefore, in such cases, institutions should be exempted from the due diligence requirement. Institutions and payment institutions should ensure in their selection and assessment process that the service provider is suitable. Therefore, for all outsourcing arrangements to service providers, a due diligence process is required. This process can in some cases, e.g. within a group or IPS, be quite simple and should be performed in any case on a risk-based approach, i.e. taking into account the criticality of the function. The due diligence section focuses on the outsourcing of functions that are critical or important. Institutions are and remain fully responsible for the outsourced function and for performing the due diligence process. It is not to the responsibility of competent authorities to perform the due diligence process, as they are not responsible for the supervision of service providers. At the group/IPS level, the due diligence process should be performed; however, it can be done centrally. See group/IPS section. The guidelines have been amended and clarified Paragraph 53 One respondent considered that institutions should also ensure that the service provider has appropriate and sufficient 'infrastructure, in particular software, systems, etc.'. All this should be covered in the due diligence process, which refers to the appropriateness of IT resources. No change 106 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals Paragraphs 54 and 55 A few respondents sought clarification on how the service provider's nature, scale and complexity provides information on its ability and suitability to perform the service and what to consider as its 'nature'. The nature of a service provider (e.g. regulated or unregulated), its size and the type of services it provides can give useful and effective information on the risks that an institution may face. No change Paragraph 56 Some respondents pointed out that, despite the importance of the ESG factors, no agreed taxonomy exists and guidance on how to integrate them into outsourcing arrangements would be more appropriate than simply mandating specific standards that may not be suitable for the service to be provided each time. The guidelines refer to the code of conduct of the institution and to human rights; institutions need to comply with both, even if they have outsourced functions. The framework for sustainable finance, including ESG factors, will be developed in more detail in the future. No change Question 9 Section 9.3 General comments Paragraph 57 Some respondents commented that the risk assessment section could better differentiate between requirements for critical or important outsourcing arrangements and for non-critical arrangements. A few respondents felt that the risk assessment requirements were too demanding and not tailored to intragroup outsourcing arrangements. A few respondents highlighted that it could be difficult for institutions to perform the risk assessment of sub-outsourcing activities and suggested entities analyse their provider's sub- outsourcing policies to guarantee adequate control of their risks and service level agreements, instead of actually verifying full compliance by each sub-outsourced provider. Institutions should assess the risk before entering into an outsourcing arrangement and, in particular, should assess the criticality of the function. A risk assessment is needed for all outsourcing arrangements, even if in some cases it might be trivial. At the group/IPS level, the risk assessment can be done centrally, but institutions remain responsible for the decision to enter into the outsourcing arrangement. See section on groups/IPSs. Sub-outsourcing, in particular of critical or important functions (or part of them), should be in the scope of the risk assessment. No change 107 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals Paragraph 58 Several respondents considered that the requirement to perform and document scenario-based risk assessments is too prescriptive and not proportionate, as it applies to each outsourcing arrangement. They consider that adequate risk management is also possible without using scenarios of risk events, in particular for non-critical outsourcing arrangements. One respondent considered that payment and electronic money institutions should not apply this requirement for the sake of proportionality and because the PSD2 and the EBA Guidelines on IT security do not require the general application of a scenario- based approach to risk management. The comments have been taken into account and the supervisory expectations have been clarified. The risk assessment, in particular for payment institutions and small and non-complex institutions, can be qualitative. Scenario analysis is an appropriate tool to assess operational risks; sometimes the risk assessment may be trivial and, depending on the scope of the outsourcing arrangement, no formal scenario analysis may be needed. The guidelines have been clarified One respondent asked for clarification on whether the estimation of the increase or decrease in operational risk as a result of an outsourcing arrangement could be qualitative. One respondent asked for clarification on whether the assessment is expected only as part of the decision-making process before entering into an arrangement or if it should be undertaken periodically. The risk assessment should be done before entering into an arrangement, but institutions should monitor and manage their risk on an ongoing basis, i.e. risk assessments are not a one-off requirement but are part of the continuous management of institutions' risks. Paragraph 59 One respondent considered that the assessments of concentration and step-in risks duplicate other regulatory requirements that already cover those risks, such as business continuity planning and recovery and resolution planning. Those risks are relevant for the purpose of these guidelines. No change Paragraph 59 Several respondents commented that it is not easy for an institution to assess concentration risk from outsourcing arrangements to a dominant service provider, as an institution would not have access to the (confidential and commercial) information required to conduct the assessment. This type of The concentration risk of the institution towards a service provider should be assessed by the institution in the light of all outsourcing arrangement towards that service provider. The guidelines have been clarified 108 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals concentration risk assessment, i.e. at market level, should instead be the responsibility of competent authorities. The register and the information to be provided in it should facilitate the assessment of concentrations at market level by competent authorities. Paragraph 60 Several respondents considered it difficult for institutions, in practice, to have access to the relevant information to conduct risk assessments of multiple sub-outsourcers. Institutions should be responsible only for the relationship with their direct provider, and service providers should be responsible for, or at least participate in, the risk assessments in the case of sub- outsourcing. If part of a critical or important function has been outsourced to a sub-service provider, this means that the institution gave its consent and therefore has assessed that the relevant information could be provided and that sub-outsourcing does not unduly increase its operational risk. No change Paragraph 61(a) and (c) Some respondents asked for clarification on the meaning of 'sensitivity measures' and 'oversight limitations'. One respondent suggested that the word 'sensitivity' be replaced with 'criticality'. Institutions should take measures to protect data in the light of their sensitivity (i.e. if they are of a personal or confidential nature). Outsourcing arrangements should not impede institutions' ability to oversee functions and competent authorities' ability to exercise their supervisory task, i.e. their should not be oversight limitations. The guidelines have been clarified Paragraph 61(d) Several respondents considered that this requirement was too prescriptive and would significantly increase legal costs and the time to market, without being necessary for the overall risk assessment. Political risks are a factor of operational risks and should be taken into account No change Paragraph 61(d)(iii) and (e) A few respondents argued that data protection issues should not be addressed by the EBA outsourcing guidelines, but should be left to the applicable general data protection rules. Data protection issues are not addressed by the EBA. A reference to the GDPR is nevertheless necessary to highlight the applicable framework and clarify the supervisory expectations. No change 109 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals Paragraph 61(e) Some respondents considered that this requirement should be applicable only to IT outsourcing, as it is typically designed for services related to data centres. One respondent asked whether security measures should be set out and defined in the outsourcing agreement. This paragraph is obviously oriented towards IT; it does not need to be clarified further. If specific data protection measures are relevant, they should be mentioned in the agreement between the institution and the service provider. For payment and electronic money institutions, the EBA Guidelines on IT security measures should be read in conjunction with these guidelines. No change One respondent suggested that, for payment and electronic money institutions, this sub-paragraph be replaced with a reference to the EBA's IT security guidelines. Question 10 Section 10 General comments Many respondents asked that the guidelines be shorter, less specific and more principle-based regarding the contractual requirements. The whole section should apply only to the outsourcing of critical and important functions. One respondent considered that frequent use of terms such as 'should include at the least', in areas that are relevant to contracts, could encourage laundry lists and gold plating approaches and may lead to unnecessary friction and uncertainty during contract negotiations/repapering. The guidelines have been clarified and focus on the outsourcing of functions that are critical or important. However, written outsourcing arrangements are required for all forms of outsourcing. The guidelines require a minimum set of contractual requirements and leave room for institutions to add further contractual clauses as required. The guidelines have been clarified Paragraph 62 Some respondents asked for clarification on what can be considered a written agreement, in particular to avoid restricting electronic signatures and digital contracting. Making reference to the eIDAS Regulation would be useful to this end. All forms that are considered as 'written forms' under national law (including electronic forms) can be considered as a written agreement. The guidelines cannot specify this further. No change Paragraph 63 A few respondents suggested that standard contractual clauses be provided for the supplier negotiation process. Otherwise, financial institutions may find difficulty negotiating the terms of It is not to the responsibility of the EBA to define a standard contractual clause. No change 110 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals the guidelines with some large suppliers, e.g. the exercise of unrestricted access rights. Paragraph 63(a) One respondent considered that describing the outsourced function should not be required for standardised services such as cloud services where service descriptions are usually not included in contracts. A clear description of the outsourced function should be provided. No change Paragraph 63(b) Some respondents did not consider it necessary to include an end date in the contract, provided that termination provisions are included. The comment has been accommodated. The guidelines have been revised Paragraph 63(e) Several respondents viewed this requirement as burdensome and costly, as locations can change, especially for cloud-based service providers. One respondent considered that the requirement in paragraph 63(e) that the outsourcing agreement must include the 'location' where data will be kept presents serious security concerns in the context of cloud services, including exposing the infrastructure and data centre personnel to increased risk of attacks. The possible locations (i.e. country or region) should be mentioned, as this has an impact on the risks. Institutions need the exact location of the service provision to be able to fulfil their regulatory obligations, including executing audit rights, where needed. The guidelines have been clarified Paragraph 63(h) Several respondents viewed this requirement as too broad, especially as service providers will be reluctant to accept such a clause. A few respondents suggested that the term 'unrestricted right' be replaced by 'necessary, appropriate or effective right'. The EBA considers that this requirement is fully in line with other regulatory requirements. The scope of arrangements for which such rights must exist has been further specified in Section 13.3. The guidelines have been amended Paragraph 64(b) One respondent noted that it is not possible for each service to define quantitative and qualitative performance targets and It should be possible to specify indicators or quantitative and qualitative performance targets regarding the agreed service level. No change 111 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals suggested that the term 'as applicable' be added to the sentence. Paragraph 64(e) One respondent considered it inappropriate to impose specific mandatory insurance requirements on the service provider, as usual insurance policies will be used. It is not a mandatory requirement to impose insurance requirements, but, if certain insurance policies are required, this should be specified in the contract. No change Paragraph 64(h) and (i) Some respondents considered that no specific clauses in relation to insolvency law should be included, as general national insolvency law provisions will prevail over contracts. The EBA guidelines cannot provide sufficient legal clarity and should only include a requirement to reasonably address the insolvency risk. Ensuring access to data is part of the business continuity measures. The guidelines do not interfere with the insolvency regulation and proceedings. No change Section 10.1 Several respondents suggested that a more proportionate approach on sub-outsourcing be taken, as this would not necessarily create more risks. In addition, respondents considered that requiring a high level of control over sub- contractors would raise practical issues, in particular regarding payment and cloud services. It is indeed extremely difficult for an institution to control a cloud service provider's outsourcing chain due to its dynamic nature. Several respondents asked for confirmation on whether the whole sub-section applies only to the outsourcing of critical and important functions. A few respondents suggested that the service provider should be held liable for any activity performed by third parties and that financial institutions should be kept informed of any sub- outsourcing by the service provider and should be able to swiftly The section on sub-outsourcing applies to critical and important functions that have been outsourced by institutions. If such functions or material parts of them are sub-outsourced, the additional requirements apply. However, institutions may impose similar requirements also for other outsourcing arrangements, e.g. if they assume that the sub-outsourcing would increase their risks materially. In any case, institutions remain fully responsible for complying with all regulatory requirements when outsourcing functions. The liability of the service provider is part of the contractual arrangements that should be agreed between the service provider and the institution. The guidelines have been clarified 112 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals exit the outsourcing agreement without cost. In such cases, institutions should be allowed to relax sub-outsourcing controls. Paragraph 65(d) Some respondents considered that the prior approval requirement would be extremely challenging to obtain, especially for cloud or standardised services. It should be clarified whether the approval is of a general nature or if the institution should grant its approval to each case of sub- outsourcing. One respondent suggested aligning the language with Article 28(2) GDPR, which uses the terms 'specific or general written authorisation' instead of 'approval', and 'processing of personal data' instead of 'sub-outsourcing data'. The guidelines have been clarified: prior authorisation can be provided in general terms. The guidelines have been clarified Paragraph 65(e) One respondent asked for the expression 'in particular where' to be removed from the sentence to align it with the cloud recommendations and to avoid creating conflicting interpretations. The paragraph is clear enough and specifies the obligations in terms of the information needed, which aim to ensure that institutions can monitor and manage the risks of outsourcing arrangements where sub-outsourcing is planned or changes will occur. The guidelines have been clarified One respondent asked for clarification on whether the service provider must inform the institution in all cases of changes to sub-contractors and prior to the sub-outsourcing arrangement. The notification period to be set should allow the outsourcing institution and the payment institution to carry out a risk assessment of the proposed changes before the changes come into effect. Paragraph 65(g) Several respondents considered that the right to object should only be optional, provided that the notification requirement and the right to terminate an agreement in the case of undue sub- outsourcing are ensured. Institutions have the final responsibility for the function and need to be informed about sub-outsourcing of critical or important functions. Where sub-outsourcing occurs, in the absence of an approval or no objection (depending on what is agreed), institutions should be able to terminate the contract. The guidelines have been clarified 113 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals Paragraph 66 Several respondents requested clarification on whether the sub- contractor is not and should not be directly engaged with the institution. If this is the case, the obligations of paragraph 66 should be undertaken by the direct service provider on behalf of the sub-contractor. Several respondents asked whether the requirements apply to direct sub-contractors or to the whole chain of sub-outsourcing. In the latter case, respondents consider that it would be difficult to achieve compliance when sub-contractors provide only small parts of services. The requirements should therefore be proportionate to the role fulfilled and activity performed. The sub-contractor is not obliged to directly engage with the institution. Institutions and service providers can organise the internal relationships themselves. However, it must be ensured that all regulatory requirements are respected and, where necessary, audit rights are granted. The section on sub-outsourcing applies to the chain of sub- outsourcing providers. The guidelines have been clarified Paragraph 66(b) Some respondents asked for clarification on whether the audit and access rights would concern only the elements of the outsourcing that the sub-contractor is actually performing. The audit rights relate to what is relevant for the performed function. No change Paragraph 67 One respondent considered that there is an inconsistency between this paragraph and paragraph 65(g), as the latter states that institutions have the right to object to any intended sub- outsourcing, while the former states 'if such a right was agreed'. Some respondents considered that the outsourcing institution should not have to impose its policy on a service provider, as the latter should have its own policy. These paragraphs should be read in conjunction and do not contradict each other. No change Paragraph 68 One respondent asked for clarification on what the appropriate security standards are and asked if this could be those agreed in the contract or if it must be internationally accepted standards. It is the institution's responsibility to define what the\nappropriate security standards are; further guidelines will be provided separately on the expectation of IT security measures. The guidelines\nhave been clarified 114 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals One respondent asked for clarification on the meaning of 'relevant providers' and asked if this was synonymous with providers supplying critical or important functions. The word 'relevant' means where necessary in the specific case. It is not related to the service provider. Paragraph 70 Some respondents asked for clarification on what is meant by sensitive data and a risk-based approach, in particular whether the latter concerns a risk-based approach to locate data centres or an approach based on country risk. In the case of outsourcing to cloud service providers and other outsourcing arrangements that involve the handling or transfer of personal or confidential data, institutions and payment institutions should adopt a risk-based approach to data storage and data processing location(s) (i.e. country or region) and information security considerations. In this particular case, 'risk- based approach' means that the risks related to the location and storage of data should be considered and managed in the light of the nature of the data (i.e. personal, confidential, non- confidential, public, etc.). No change Paragraph 71 One respondent suggested that the language be aligned with the cloud recommendation, in particular regarding the fact that service providers should comply with requirements regarding the protection of data that are applicable to them and not with requirements applicable to institutions. One respondent considered that the guidelines should recognise service providers' confidentiality obligations to other clients, security concerns, competition issues (e.g. audits by competitors) and professional obligations. The guidelines are addressed to institutions and not to service providers. The guidelines recognise multi-tenant environments. When performing audits in multi-client environments, care should be taken that risks to another client's environment (e.g. the impact on service levels, the availability of data, confidentiality aspects) are avoided or mitigated. No change Paragraph 72 Several respondents consider that access rights should be limited to what is relevant for the function provided and only be required for critical and important outsourcing arrangements. The guidelines have been amended regarding the scope of functions for which unrestricted audit rights are required. The guidelines have been amended 115 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals Paragraph 72(a) Several respondents considered that making arrangements for physical access to (all) data centres is unattainable and irrelevant (as there is likely to be nothing to see or the data are split over multiple locations) and that the guidelines should instead focus on relevant system information. One respondent considered that the competent authority's access to information should be done via the outsourcing institution and that the authority should not have direct access. Both institutions and competent authorities should have unrestricted audit and access rights. This section has been clarified and sets out the appropriate audit techniques. Competent authorities have, by law, information gathering and information rights, including at service providers in Member States. The guidelines have been clarified Paragraph 72(b) One respondent considered that a service provider should have the right to object to an inspection based on conflicts or competition. Audit rights for institutions and competent authorities should be ensured and should be effective. Where such rights cannot be enforced for critical and important functions, such functions cannot be outsourced. The guidelines have been clarified Paragraph 73 One respondent asked for clarification on whether the audit function of the service provider can also perform the audit if the service provider has a banking licence. The guidelines have been clarified. However, institutions cannot rely over time solely on the audit reports received form the service provider with regard to critical or important functions. The guidelines have been clarified Paragraph 73 One respondent considered that providing complete access to financial information was not possible for publicly listed service providers that are subject to strict reporting and disclosure rules and that such a requirement could inappropriately include information relating to other customers of the service provider. The guidelines do not refer to the points mentioned, but audit and access rights must exist for what is relevant in the context of the outsourcing arrangement. No change Paragraphs 74 and 75 A high number of respondents considered that, to keep the cost of auditing low, especially in groups and cooperative banks, the final sentence should be removed. Shared (pooled audit) auditing or third-party reports should be sufficient if they are reliable and delivered in a timely manner, For the outsourcing of critical or important functions, institutions and payment institutions should assess whether third-party certifications and reports, as referred to in paragraph 90(b), are adequate and sufficient to comply with The guidelines have been clarified 116 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals and institutions and payment institutions should be free to decide whether further action is needed. their regulatory obligations and should not rely solely on these reports over time. This limitation does not refer to pooled or external audits commissioned by the institution. Paragraph 75(f) Some respondents suggested that the requirement be deleted, as it is not contractually conceivable, especially in groups or networks. Audits should also be performed in group or IPS contexts. See comments on groups/IPSs. The guidelines have been clarified Paragraph 76 Some respondents stated that payment and electronic money institutions are not subject to the CRD framework for SREP but have their own framework on IT security and thus should not be required to carry out security penetration testing. This requirement refers only to institutions (i.e. institutions subject to the CRD), not to payment institutions, which by contrast should follow the framework applicable to them. The guidelines have been clarified Paragraph 77 Some respondents suggested that the final part of the sentence be deleted and that the provision be aligned with the cloud recommendations. In severe events and in some cases that depend on the nature of the outsourced function (e.g. cash management services, money transportation), it would not be possible to notify service providers about audits well in advance. The guidelines have been clarified Paragraph 79 Some respondents asked for the guidelines to specify what could be considered 'alternative ways to provide a similar level of assurance'. When performing audits in multi-client environments, care should be taken that risks to another client's environment (e.g. the impact on service levels, the availability of data, confidentiality aspects) are avoided or mitigated. The guidelines have been clarified Paragraph 80 One respondent considered that a single institution could ensure only its own auditor's skills, not those of the whole pool of auditors. Institutions are responsible for performing appropriate audits; similar to the review of certifications, participating institutions can, for example, jointly or by the exchange of relevant information, validate the suitability of auditors. No change 117 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals Section 10.4 Some respondents asked for the guidelines to better take into account IPSs and cooperatives, where termination can happen only on the basis of coordinated democratic processes. Even in the case of groups/IPSs, institutions should be able to terminate arrangements, e.g. in the case of a recovery or resolution scenario. No change Paragraph 81 Some respondents asked why the guidelines referenced national law when clarifying what is meant by cross-border outsourcing arrangements and asked if that law applies to the institution or to the service provider. Some respondents suggested that the governing law of the agreement be referred to instead. Some respondents considered that the guidelines should require that reasonable termination rights be included in the agreement, but should not specify termination events, as some expectations of the guidelines, such as termination rights in the case of a breach of contract or any weakness of IT security, are not in line with some national laws and would be unenforceable. The guidelines have been revised and now make reference to the applicable law, i.e. this may include national law, governing law and provisions with extraterritorial effect that have been included in the contract. The guidelines provide a list of non-exhaustive situations that may lead to the termination of contracts, based on the contractual arrangement. If institutions cannot enforce contracts, and this leads to their non-compliance with regulatory requirements, institutions must take appropriate action. The guidelines have been clarified Paragraph 81(b) Some respondents considered that this provision is difficult to obtain from service providers and proposed that this sentence be deleted. Where events happen that impede the performance of the service, institutions should be able to terminate the agreement, as, due to the inappropriateness of the service, the service No change provider may need to be substituted. Paragraph 81(c) One respondent asked for clarification on whether the sub- outsourcing arrangements mentioned were only those related to critical and important functions. The sub-outsourcing arrangements mentioned are only those related to critical and important functions. This paragraph should be read in conjunction with the section on sub- outsourcing. No change Question 11 118 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals Section 11 General comments Some respondents stated that it would be challenging to monitor arrangements and performance on a continuous basis. The guidelines have been clarified. While institutions must monitor their outsourcing arrangements, the focus should be on the outsourcing of critical or important functions. Monitoring arrangements with third parties in general should be done on an ongoing basis and through a risk-based approach. See also comments below. The guidelines have been clarified Some respondents considered that the requirements of the section should apply only to outsourcing arrangements of critical and important functions. Paragraph 83 Some respondents asked whether a central monitoring body must be established or if it is sufficient that the monitoring is performed by the institution's area receiving the service. The three lines of defence model should be applied for the management, control and auditing of outsourcing arrangements. The guidelines One respondent suggested that the word 'ongoing' be replaced with the word 'regular' and another respondent suggested that a risk-based approach be referred to, especially for chain outsourcing. Monitoring should be done on a risk-based approach. The word 'ongoing' stresses the fact that this is not a 'one-off' exercise and the interval of monitoring activities should consider the risks and can range from daily monitoring activities to longer intervals. have been clarified Paragraph 85 Several respondents requested a clarification on the expected frequency of updates to the risk assessment. One respondent suggested that the term 'any risk' be replaced with 'material risk' and added that reporting should be done pursuant to the internal risk reporting governance framework. The frequency is to be set by the institution and will take into account the monitoring results and the criticality of the function. The comment has been accommodated: the management body should regularly receive risk reports regarding critical or important functions. Board committees (i.e. risk committees) may assist the\nmanagement body in its tasks, but the responsibility lies with the management body. The guidelines have been clarified Some respondents asked about the extent to which the reporting can be delegated to committees. Paragraph 88 Some respondents wanted the guidelines to specify the expected character of key performance indicators and key control indicators. It is the institution's responsibility to define suitable indicators for the monitoring of the specific outsourcing arrangement. No change 119 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals Question 12 Some respondents asked that it be ensured that the requirements in this section were consistent with the BRRD. Several respondents considered that the whole section should apply only to outsourcing arrangements of critical and important functions. The EBA reviewed the guidelines and concluded that they are consistent with the BRRD. The guidelines have been clarified Some respondents considered that exit strategies should be required only when the continuity of services is endangered. Section 12 General comments A high number of respondents thought that the requirements of this section should apply only at the group/network level and/or to the central institution in cooperatives and IPSs. Only a pooled exit strategy should be required. The guidelines focus more on the outsourcing of important or critical functions. The comment has been accommodated. The guidelines provide a list of situations in which exit strategies should be implemented. In addition, respondents suggested that specificities of intragroup outsourcing arrangements be better reflected: since the likelihood that a service provider inside the group will be terminated or will fail is extremely low, greater visibility and cooperation is available and adjustments to intragroup arrangements are covered by business continuity plans. An institution may also not be in a position to exit an arrangement if this would conflict with the group policy or governance. See comment on groups/IPSs. An exit strategy can be defined centrally. Paragraph 90 Several respondents were concerned that the term 'tested' could be misinterpreted, resulting in a successful transfer or in- housing of outsourced functions being requested, which would in fact be very burdensome. The comment has been accommodated and 'where appropriate' has been added; in addition, it was clarified that the actual exit does not need to be tested in terms of a switch to another provider. The guidelines have been clarified 120 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals Paragraph 90(a) One respondent asked the EBA to confirm that institutions are not required to have in place alternative providers. The guidelines specify that alternative solutions should be identified, but that no requirement exists to have alternate arrangements in place. No change Paragraph 90(b) One respondent asked whether the scenario of a change in service provider needs to be included in the business continuity plan. The change of service providers may be part of a business continuity plan. No change Paragraph 91(e) One respondent considered that unacceptable service levels that can trigger an exit cannot be determined ex ante in a contract. They should also not be considered as the only cases in which exit from the arrangement may occur. The institution can define ex ante performance indicators. See also comments regarding the ongoing monitoring of outsourcing arrangements. No change Question 13 Section 13 General comments Some respondents considered that there should not be additional new reporting requirements for payment and electronic money institutions. Such institutions are already subject to the PSD2 notification requirements and should not be required to have a register. Several respondents considered that intragroup outsourcing arrangements should be excluded from the information requirements. In particular, in IPSs or cooperatives in which a high number of affiliated institutions outsource the same function, providing the same set of information does not have added value. The guidelines specify that payment and electronic money institutions already need to document all outsourcing arrangements. The register should be made available on request. See comment on groups/IPSs. A centralised register can be kept. The guidelines have been clarified 121 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals Paragraph 92 Some respondents considered that making a full register available within each SREP or at least every three years represents a significant volume of information that does not allow for risk-sensitive supervision. A high number of respondents made the following suggestions: that transmission be limited when supervisors request an inspection, that a waiver be provided for small institutions, that the scope of the register be reduced to critical and important functions and that the information required be limited (i.e. a brief description of the function, its criticality, contact details of the provider), with competent authorities then able to ask for more details when necessary. Several respondents asked for confirmation that no prior approval by the competent authority is necessary for an outsourcing arrangement. The requirement to inform competent authorities about outsourcing arrangements should be removed or at least changed to an ex post notification. The register should be available upon request. The contents of the register have been streamlined, in particular for non- material outsourcing arrangements. See also comments on the register and in Section 11 on documentation. The guidelines do neither require nor prevent competent authorities from applying a prior approval process for outsourcing arrangements. Supervision is done on a risk-based approach and, depending on the size and complexity of institutions, a different frequency for reviews is applied. Institutions and payment institutions should adequately inform competent authorities in a timely manner or engage in a supervisory dialogue with regard to planned outsourcing of critical or important functions and/or where an outsourced function has become critical or important. The guidelines have been clarified Paragraph 94 Some respondents requested that this requirement be deleted, since the register would be sufficient. See comments on paragraph 92. The guidelines have been clarified Paragraph 95 Some respondents asked for a clarification on the meaning of 'undue delay' and of 'material changes and events'. See comments on paragraph 92. The guidelines have been clarified Question 14 122 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals Title V General comments One respondent considered that this section should be integrated into the EBA SREP guidelines. One respondent wanted to add that competent and resolution authorities, and digital service providers' supervisory authorities, should cooperate for the monitoring of outsourcing risks. These guidelines should be read in conjunction with the SREP guidelines. These guidelines are addressed to competent authorities. However, references and links to the BRRD framework are given where relevant. In particular, where risk concentrations are identified that pose risks to the stability of the financial market, the resolution authority should be informed about the new potential critical function (i.e. 'critical function' as defined under the BRRD). No change Paragraph 103 Several respondents asked that the specificities of intragroup outsourcing arrangements be better take into account, e.g. for the assessment of concentration risk. Concentration risks within an institution, including on a consolidated basis, caused by multiple outsourcing arrangements with a single service provider, closely connected service providers or multiple outsourcing arrangements within the same business area should be considered and assessed on a macro level by the competent authority. No change Paragraph 104 Several respondents asked for a clarification on if and how competent authorities would inform entities about their calculation of concentration risk at a sector level, and what the consequences would be of evidence of a concentration risk, e.g. in the provision of cloud-based outsourced services. Competent authorities should maintain a dialogue with the supervised entities. However, the concentration risk is assessed by competent authorities to identify risks for the financial stability; no public communication is required. No change Paragraph 105 Some respondents asked the EBA to better describe the situations in which a competent authority could ask an institution to exit from an arrangement to limit the business risk. The requirement to exit should be a last resort and prior steps and warnings should be defined as part of a supervisor's policy and made public by competent authorities. No further clarification can be provided. The measures of competent authorities need to take into account in the situation in question. General principles of administrative law apply. This does not need to be specified in EBA guidelines. No change 123 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals Question 15 Annex 1 Several respondents asked for clarification on whether the template provided was only an example; respondents asked if the EBA would explicitly allow institutions to have a different structure, template or application as long as it contained the required information. The template was not intended to be mandatory and has been deleted. The guidelines have been amended Question 16 Impact assessment General comments Some respondents considered that the impact assessment failed to demonstrate that the benefits outweighed the costs. The latter are underestimated, as the guidelines will trigger significant financial, IT and administrative costs and an increased workload in terms of updating contracts, processes and procedures and performing on-going controls. Specific one-off costs identified include the design and set up of a database, the analysis of all contracts and the drafting of new clauses. Some respondents considered that the assessment underestimates the resources that will be necessary to maintain the register for all arrangements and for competent authorities to process the registers. The impact assessment has been updated, taking into account changes made to the guidelines. The impact assessed reflects only the costs triggered by the guidelines and not the costs triggered by other regulatory products that already exist. The guidelines and the impact assessment have been updated Risk assessment Some respondents considered that extending the risk assessment requirements to all third-party arrangements would have a significant economic impact. This should not have a significant financial impact, as institutions are already obliged to identify, manage and monitor all of their risks. No sufficiently detailed information was provided by respondents to demonstrate the additional costs triggered specifically by the guidelines. The guidelines and the impact assessment have been updated 124 FINAL REPORT ON THE GUIDELINES ON OUTSOURCING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA's analysis Amendments to the proposals Cooperation agreements One respondent found it difficult to understand the choice of Option A when the assessment acknowledged the length of negotiations for cooperation agreements and the impact of this on institutions' policies and practices.

            "1. Executive summary Directive 2014/59/EU1, establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions, investment firms and related entities (the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive, or BRRD) specifies a Union-wide framework for crisis prevention, management and resolution of these entities. These guidelines have been developed by the EBA, in close cooperation with the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), pursuant to Article 5(7) of the BRRD, and specify the range of scenarios of severe macroeconomic and financial distress which should be considered by institutions to test the effectiveness of recovery options and the adequacy of the indicators contained in their recovery plans. The objective of a recovery plan is not to forecast the factors that could prompt a crisis, but rather to identify the actions that might be available to counter those factors and to assess whether they are robust enough and their nature is sufficiently varied to cope with a wide range of shocks of different natures. For this purpose, the scenarios of severe macroeconomic and financial distress should be designed in a way that they would threaten the failure of an institution or group if recovery measures were not implemented in a timely manner. However, given that the aim of a recovery plan is to prove the capacity to restore the viability of an institution, these scenarios should be designed as 'near-default' situations; i.e. they should bring an institution close to failure but no further. This element should be taken into consideration for example when considering using reverse stress testing to identify the most appropriate scenarios. The guidelines stipulate that at least three scenarios of severe macroeconomic and financial distress should be included to ensure coverage of a system-wide event, an idiosyncratic event and a combination of system-wide and idiosyncratic events. In line with the principle of proportionality, global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs) and other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs) identified pursuant to Article 131 of the CRD should include at least four scenarios. The guidelines recognise that the risks that each institution faces vary significantly according to its business and funding model, its activities and structure, its size or its interconnectedness to other institutions or to the financial system in general. Moving from this premise, to ensure that recovery plans are tested against the main types of system-wide and idiosyncratic events, the guidelines identify the specific factors and events that should be taken into account in determining the appropriate scenarios. These factors have been selected as those that most typically threaten the failure of institutions or groups. However, the overriding principle remains 1 Directive 2014/59/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms and amending Council Directive 82/891/EEC, and Directives 2001/24/EC, 2002/47/EC, 2004/25/EC, 2005/56/EC, 2007/36/EC, 2011/35/EU, 2012/30/EU and 2013/36/EU, and Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010 and (EU) No 648/2012, (OJ L 173, 12.6.2014, p.190). 3 RUNNING TITLE COMES HERE IN RUNNING TITLE STYLE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY that the scenarios should be based on the events and factors that are the most relevant to the institution or group. Hence, different events should be used where those are more relevant. On this basis and in line with the provisions of the BRRD on the assessment of recovery plans and the related technical standards pursuant to Article 6(8), competent authorities will assess the adequacy of the scenarios chosen by the banks. The EBA launched a public consultation on 20 May 2013 (EBA/CP/2013/09) on the guidelines. The decision behind this early consultation stage was to allow phasing of the delivery of the large number of technical standards/guidelines that the EBA is required to produce as mandated by the BRRD. By the time the consultation was launched, the EBA was mandated to develop technical standards for the range of scenarios to be used by firms to test their recovery plans. Following the change of the mandate, the draft technical standards have been transposed to fit the structure of the guidelines, whilst also taking into account the feedback received from respondents during the consultation period. The comments received from stakeholders have been considered. Comments, the EBA's analysis and any consequent changes to the guidelines are reported in the feedback table at the end of this paper. The guidelines are structured into three titles. The first title establishes the subject matter and scope of the guidelines. Title 2 provides design principles for the range of scenarios and the range of scenarios to be considered. Finally, Title 3 determines when the guidelines take effect. 4 RUNNING TITLE COMES HERE IN RUNNING TITLE STYLE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY",
            "2. Background and rationale At the international level, any initiatives on recovery and resolution planning are carried out under the auspices of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), which in its Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions2 identifies the essential elements of recovery and resolution plans, and recommends recovery and resolution plans to be in place at least for any financial institution that could be systemically significant or critical if it fails. At the EU level, co-legislators have adopted Directive 2014/59/EU (the BRRD), establishing a recovery and resolution framework in the European Union. The EBA has developed these guidelines in accordance with the mandate contained in Article 5(7) of the BRRD, which mandates the EBA to develop guidelines to specify the range of scenarios of severe macroeconomic and financial distress to be used to assess the arrangements that institutions have in place and the measures that would be adopted to maintain or restore the institutions' viability in a timely manner. Rationale and regulatory approach followed in the GL The BRRD stipulates in Article 5(6) that the competent authorities should ensure that firms test their recovery plans against a range of scenarios of severe macroeconomic and financial distress, varying in their severity, including system-wide events, legal entity-specific stress and group-wide stress, while Article 7(6) requires group recovery plans to include a range of recovery options specifying actions to address those scenarios. At the same time Article 5(7) of the BRRD mandates the EBA to develop, in close cooperation with the ESRB, guidelines specifying the range of scenarios to be used for the purposes of Article 5(6). Following this mandate, these guidelines are prepared taking into account the FSB Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions, the FSB Guidance on Recovery Triggers and Stress Scenarios, and current supervisory practices. The guidelines cover the key elements and essential issues that should be addressed by institutions when developing severe macroeconomic and financial distress scenarios against which the recovery plan will be tested. Drafting a recovery plan is incumbent upon institutions or groups and is to be undertaken prior to a crisis in order to assess the potential options that an institution or a group could itself implement to restore financial strength and viability should the institution or group come under severe stress. Recovery plans must be based on the assumption that extraordinary public financial support would not be provided. Financial institutions are responsible for drafting and owning their own plans, but they will be assessed by the relevant competent authority or authorities."

Following the change to the mandate, the draft technical standards were transposed to fit the structure of guidelines, whilst also taking into account the feedback received from respondents during the consultation period. Summary of key issues and the EBA's response In total, sixteen (16) responses were received; two (2) respondents asked for their response not to be published but the remainder were published on the EBA website. On the whole, the respondents welcomed the proposals and the efforts to harmonise the practices with scenarios that are being used to test the recovery plans. Many of the respondents welcomed the emphasis that scenarios should be used to test the recovery plan and to facilitate its assessment and the ability of the group to recover, rather than building recovery plans around a given set of scenarios. Some of the respondents considered the proposals too detailed or prescriptive to fit individual institutions, advocating more flexibility. It was considered that 'over-engineered' scenarios may create a ranking or hierarchy of recovery options for each particular scenario. Furthermore, recovery plans need to be tailor-made for each institution/group and appropriately reflect its specificities. The range of respondents' views was quite wide as far as the testing of the recovery plans on the group or individual level was concerned. Some respondents claimed that scenarios should be developed and tested at group level only, while others replied that they have already developed scenarios to test recovery plans both at individual and group level and considered these as useful. Some respondents argued that it is important to focus only on a few scenarios that are truly relevant to the institutions. This view was endorsed in particular in those cases when the respondent was supporting testing at group level only. 15 RUNNING TITLE COMES HERE IN RUNNING TITLE STYLE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY One issue that was raised in many replies related to the suggestion to adopt reverse stress testing as a tool for identifying scenarios that would threaten to cause the failure of the institution. Some respondents considered this to be a useful tool, whereas others considered the additional value of reverse stress testing of scenarios to be of minor significance. Some respondents considered that the proposals do not cover coordination between home/host authorities, which may give rise to significant additional costs for banks resulting from the preparation of local recovery plans. One respondent requested clarification on whether and how the 'simplified obligations' for smaller and simpler institutions are to be applied in the context of recovery plans. 16 RUNNING TITLE COMES HERE IN RUNNING TITLE STYLE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY"

            "1. Executive Summary These guidelines are issued pursuant to Article 16(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 on the EBA's own initiative in order to ensure common, uniform and consistent application of Union law and to establish consistent, efficient and effective supervisory practices within the European System of Financial Supervision ('ESFS'). A significant number of credit institutions apply the International Financial Reporting Standards® ('IFRS® Standards') as these are incorporated into the EU legal framework through EU regulations, in accordance with the procedures set out in Regulation (EC) No 1606/20021. IFRS 9 Financial Instruments ('IFRS 9'), which will replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement ('IAS 39'), for the accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 20182, requires the measurement of impairment loss allowances to be based on an expected credit loss ('ECL') accounting model rather than on an incurred loss accounting model. The EBA welcomes the move from an incurred loss model to an ECL model under IFRS 93. IFRS 9 is, overall, an improvement compared with IAS 39 in the accounting for financial instruments, and the changes to credit loss provisioning should contribute to addressing the G20's concerns about the issue of 'too little, too late' recognition of credit losses, and improve the accounting recognition of loan loss provisions by incorporating a broader range of credit information. IFRS 9 is therefore expected to address some prudential concerns and contribute to financial stability. However, the application of IFRS 9 also requires the use of judgement in the ECL assessment and measurement process, which could potentially affect the consistent application of IFRS 9 across credit institutions and the comparability of credit institutions' financial statements. In December 2015, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ('BCBS') issued supervisory guidance on credit risk and accounting for expected credit losses4 (the 'BCBS guidance'), which sets out supervisory expectations for credit institutions related to sound credit risk practices associated with implementing and applying an ECL accounting model. In addition, it contains an Annex specific to jurisdictions applying IFRS. Building on the BCBS guidance, these guidelines aim at ensuring sound credit risk management practices for credit institutions, associated with the implementation and ongoing application of ECL accounting models. The existence of supervisory guidance emphasises the importance of 1 Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 July 2002 on the application of international accounting standards (OJ L 243, 11.9.2002, p. 1). 2 Commission Regulation (EU) No 2016/2067 of 22 November 2016 amending Regulation (EC) No 1126/2008 adopting certain international accounting standards in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards International Financial Reporting Standards 9. 3 Letter to the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group ('EFRAG') of 26 June 2015 with EBA's views on the adoption of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (http://www.eba.europa.eu/documents/10180/943157/Letter+to+EFRAG+Board+on+IFRS+9+endorsement.pdf)."

In particular, Article 74 of Directive 2013/36/EU6 requires credit institutions to have 'adequate internal control mechanisms, including sound administration and accounting procedures ... that are consistent with and promote sound and effective risk management'. Article 79(1) of Directive 2013/36/EU requires competent authorities to ensure that '(b) institutions have internal methodologies that enable them to assess the credit risk of exposures to individual obligors ... and credit risk at the portfolio level' and '(c) the ongoing administration and monitoring of the various risk-bearing portfolios and exposures of institutions, including for identifying and managing problem credits and for making adequate value adjustments and provisions, is operated through effective systems'. Article 88(1)(b) of Directive 2013/36/EU also includes the principle that 'the management body must ensure the integrity of the accounting and financial reporting systems, including financial and operational controls and compliance with the law and relevant standards'. In accordance with Article 97(1) of Directive 2013/36/EU, competent authorities must review the arrangements, strategies, processes and mechanisms implemented by institutions to comply with that Directive and Regulation (EU) No 575/20137. In this regard, Article 104(1) of Directive 2013/36/EU enumerates the minimum powers that competent authorities must have, including the power 'to require the reinforcement of the arrangements, processes, mechanisms and strategies implemented in accordance with Articles 73 and 74' (Article 104(1)(b)), 'to require institutions to apply a specific provisioning policy or treatment of assets in terms of own funds requirements' (Article 104(1)(d)).",

In addition, consideration of forward-looking information, including macroeconomic factors, is a distinctive feature of an ECL model and is critical for the timely recognition of credit losses. The ECL model is also more aligned with existing regulatory practices (for credit institutions using an internal ratings-based ('IRB') approach) which require the calculation of expected credit losses rather than incurred credit losses in order to determine institutions' regulatory capital requirements.",
            "8. However, the application of IFRS 9 also requires the use of judgement in the ECL assessment and measurement process, which could potentially affect the consistent application of IFRS 9 across institutions and the comparability of credit institutions' financial statements. Therefore, the existence of supervisory guidance emphasises the importance of high-quality and consistent application of IFRS 9 and could help to promote consistent interpretations and practices.",

While these guidelines are to be applied for the assessment of credit risk from, and the measurement of ECL on, lending exposures under the applicable accounting framework, they do not set out principles and expectations targeted at specific categories of loans such as corporate, retail and project finance. In this regard, certain aspects of the guidelines may be more applicable to the individual credit assessment of a large corporate borrower, while other aspects may be more relevant to collective assessments of a particular group of retail customers.

            "14.In particular, on the considerations on proportionate application of the EBA guidelines, the EBA notes that all credit institutions applying IFRS 9 should ensure that they meet the objectives of IFRS 9 when applying the standard. However, the EBA understands that the way of meeting these objectives may differ across credit institutions; for example, different techniques or models may be used in the measurement of ECL. Credit institutions should comply with these guidelines in a proportionate manner taking into account various criteria, such as their size and internal organisation and the nature, scope and complexity of their activities and portfolios, as described in paragraph 17 of the guidelines. Credit institutions should, however, take into consideration if using practical expedients that the objective of IFRS 9 is to estimate ECL to reflect an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes (IFRS 9, paragraph 5.5.17)",

These inputs to and outputs from these functions should be well documented, and the documentation should include clear explanations supporting the analyses, estimates and reviews; o. document the methods used to validate models for ECL measurement (for example backtests); p. ensure that ECL estimates appropriately incorporate forward-looking information, including macroeconomic factors, that has not already been factored into allowances measured on an individual exposure basis. This may require management to use its experienced credit judgement to consider broad trends in the entire lending portfolio, changes in the credit institution's business model, macroeconomic factors, etc .; and q. require a process to assess the overall appropriateness of allowances in accordance with the relevant accounting framework, including a regular review of ECL models.",
            "34. A credit institution's credit risk identification process should ensure that factors that impact changes in credit risk and estimates of ECL are properly identified on a regular basis. In addition, consideration of credit risk inherent in new products and activities should be a key part of the credit risk identification process, the assessment of credit risk and measurement of ECL. 23 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT INSTITUTIONS' CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND ACCOUNTING FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY",

With respect to factors related to the character, capacity and capital of borrowers, the terms of lending exposures, and the values of assets pledged as collateral together with other credit risk mitigants that may affect the full collectability of cash flows, a credit institution should (depending on the type of exposure) consider: a. its lending policies and procedures, including its underwriting standards and lending terms, that were in effect upon initial recognition of the borrower's lending exposure, and whether the lending exposure was originated as an exception to this policy. A credit institution's lending policy should include details of its underwriting standards, and guidelines and procedures that drive the credit institution's lending approval process; b. a borrower's sources of recurring income available to meet the scheduled payments; c. a borrower's ability to generate a sufficient cash flow stream over the term of the financial instrument; d. the borrower's overall leverage level and expectations of changes to leverage; e. the incentives or willingness of borrowers to meet their obligations; f. unencumbered assets24 the borrower may pledge as collateral in the market or bilaterally in order to raise funds and expectations of changes to the value of those assets; g. reasonably possible one-off events and recurring behaviour that may affect the borrower's ability to meet contractual obligations; and h. timely evaluations of collateral value and consideration of factors that may impact the future value of collateral (bearing in mind that collateral values directly affect estimates of LGD).",

            "38. Sound credit risk methodologies should consider different potential scenarios and should not rely purely on subjective, biased or overly optimistic considerations. Credit institutions should develop and document their processes to generate relevant scenarios to be used in the estimation of ECL. In particular: a. credit institutions should demonstrate and document how ECL estimates would alter with changes in scenarios, including changes to relevant external conditions that may impact ECL estimates or components of the ECL calculation (such as PD and LGD parameters); b. credit institutions should have a documented process for determining the time horizon of the scenarios and, if relevant, how ECL is estimated for exposures whose lives exceed the period covered by the economic forecast(s) used; c. scenarios may be internally developed or outsourced. For internally developed scenarios, credit institutions should have a variety of experts, such as risk experts, economists, business managers and senior management, assisting in the selection of scenarios that are relevant to the credit institutions' credit risk exposure profile. For outsourced scenarios, credit institutions should ensure that the external provider tailors the scenarios to reflect the credit institutions' business and credit risk exposure profile, as credit institutions remain responsible for those scenarios; d. backtesting should be performed to ensure that the most relevant economic factors that affect collectability and credit risk are being considered and incorporated into ECL estimates; and e. where market indicators (such as credit default swaps ('CDS') spreads) are available, senior management may consider them to be a valid benchmark against which to check the consistency of its own judgements.",
            "39. While a credit institution does not need to identify or model every possible scenario through scenario simulations, it should consider all reasonable and supportable information that is relevant to the product, borrower, business model or economic and regulatory environment 25 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT INSTITUTIONS' CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND ACCOUNTING FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY when developing estimates of ECL. In developing such estimates for financial reporting purposes, credit institutions should consider the experience and lessons from similar exercises it has conducted for regulatory purposes (although stressed scenarios are not intended to be used directly for accounting purposes). Forward-looking information, including economic forecasts and related credit risk factors used for ECL estimates, should be consistent with inputs to other relevant estimates within the financial statements, budgets, strategic and capital plans, and other information used in managing and reporting within a credit institution.",
            "40. Senior management should be able to demonstrate that it understands and appropriately considers inherent risks when pricing lending exposures. Credit institutions should take particular care of the following fact patterns, which are potentially indicative of inadequate estimates of ECL: a. the granting of credit to borrowers based on fragile income streams (that could become non- recurrent upon a downturn) or with no documentation or limited verification of borrower income sources; b. high debt service requirements relative to the borrower's net available expected cash flows; c. flexible repayment schedules, including payment vacations, interest-only payments and negative amortisation features; d. for real estate and other asset based financing, lending of amounts equal to or exceeding the value of the financed property or otherwise failing to provide an adequate margin of collateral protection; e. undue increases in modifications of lending exposures due to financial difficulties faced by the borrower25 or renegotiations/modifications of lending exposures for other reasons (such as competitive pressures faced by credit institutions); f. circumvention of the classification and rating requirements, including rescheduling, refinancing or reclassification of lending exposures; g. undue increases in the volume of credit, especially in relation to the increase in the volume of credit by other lenders in the same market; and h. increasing volume and severity of past-due, low-quality and impaired credit.",

Credit institutions should take into account the following criteria regarding renegotiations/modifications of lending exposures: i. The allowance methodology should enable credit institutions to perform a robust assessment of credit risk and measurement of ECL such that the allowance level continues to reflect the collectability of the substance of the renegotiated/modified exposure, irrespective of whether or not the original asset is derecognised under the applicable accounting framework. ii. Renegotiations/modifications should not automatically lead to the conclusion that there has been an immediate decrease in the credit risk of the exposure. Any decrease in the reported allowance level due to improved credit risk should be supported by strong evidence. Customers should demonstrate consistently satisfactory payment performance over a reasonable period of time before credit risk would be considered to have decreased, considering also the relevant requirements for exposures in the probation period as defined in Part 2 of Annex V of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 680/2014. iii. Credit institutions should carefully consider whether the collection of loan principal is reasonably assured when repayment performance takes the form of interest payments alone, subsequent to a renegotiation or modification. In addition, further expected delays in the payment of those cash flows may evidence that credit risk has not improved, and thus the level of ECL should be reassessed carefully. iv. The methodologies should also call upon the lending staff to promptly notify the institution's accounting function when exposures are renegotiated or modified to ensure appropriate accounting for the change. For more complex renegotiations and modifications, regular communication between the lending staff and the accounting function should take place. b. Credit institutions should take into account the following criteria regarding purchased or originated credit-impaired lending exposures: i. The methodology should enable appropriate identification and accounting for purchased or originated credit-impaired lending. ii. The cash flow estimates for these lending exposures should be reviewed each reporting period and updated as necessary. Such updates should be properly supported and documented, and approved by senior management. 27 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT INSTITUTIONS' CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND ACCOUNTING FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY"

            "44. Credit institutions should take into account a number of criteria when assigning the credit risk grade upon initial recognition of a lending exposure including, to the extent relevant, product type, terms and conditions, collateral type and amount, borrower characteristics and geography or a combination thereof.",
            "45. When changing existing credit risk grades assigned, on either a portfolio or an individual basis, credit institutions should take into account other relevant factors such as, but not limited to, changes in industry outlook, business growth rates, consumer sentiment and changes in economic forecasts (such as interest rates, unemployment rates and commodity prices) as well as weaknesses in underwriting identified after initial recognition.",
            "46. The credit risk rating system should capture all lending exposures when assessing the impact of changes in credit risk, and not only those that may have experienced significant increases in credit risk, have incurred losses or are otherwise credit impaired. This is to allow for an appropriate differentiation of credit risk and grouping of lending exposures within the credit risk rating system, and to reflect the risk of individual exposures as well as, when aggregated across all exposures, the level of credit risk in the portfolio as a whole. In this context, an effective credit risk rating system should allow credit institutions to identify both migration of credit risk and significant changes in credit risk.",
            "47. Credit institutions should describe the elements of their credit risk rating system, clearly defining each credit risk grade and designating the staff responsible for the design, implementation, operation and performance of the system as well as those responsible for periodic testing and validation (i.e. the independent review function).",
            "48. Credit risk grades should be reviewed whenever relevant new information is received or a credit institution's expectation of credit risk has changed. Credit risk grades assigned should 28 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT INSTITUTIONS' CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND ACCOUNTING FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY receive a periodic formal review (for example at least annually, or more frequently if required in a jurisdiction) to reasonably ensure that those grades are accurate and up to date. Credit risk grades for individually assessed lending exposures that are higher risk or credit impaired should be reviewed more frequently than annually. ECL estimates should be updated on a timely basis to reflect changes in credit risk grades for either groups of exposures or individual exposures. Grouping based on shared credit risk characteristics",

            "50. A credit institution's methodology for grouping exposures to assess credit risk (such as by instrument type, product terms and conditions, industry/market segment, geographical location or vintages) should be documented and subject to appropriate review and internal approval by senior management.",
            "51. Lending exposures should be grouped according to shared credit risk characteristics so that changes in the level of credit risk respond to the impact of changing conditions on a common range of credit risk drivers. This includes considering the effect on the group's credit risk in response to changes in forward-looking information, including macroeconomic factors. The basis of grouping should be reviewed by senior management to ensure that exposures within the group remain homogeneous in terms of their response to credit risk drivers and that the relevant credit risk characteristics and their impact on the level of credit risk for the group have not changed over time.",
            "52. Exposures should not be grouped in such a way that an increase in the credit risk of particular exposures is obscured by the performance of the group as a whole.",
            "53. Credit institutions should have in place a robust process to ensure appropriate initial grouping of their lending exposures. Subsequently, the grouping of exposures should be re-evaluated and exposures should be re-segmented if relevant new information is received or a credit institution's changed expectations of credit risk suggest that a permanent adjustment is warranted. If a credit institution is not able to re-segment exposures on a timely basis, a temporary adjustment should be used. Use of temporary adjustments",
            "54. Credit institutions should use temporary adjustments to an allowance only as an interim solution, in particular in transient circumstances or when there is insufficient time to appropriately incorporate relevant new information into the existing credit risk rating and modelling process, or to re-segment existing groups of lending exposures, or when lending exposures within a group of lending exposures react to factors or events differently than initially expected. 29 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT INSTITUTIONS' CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND ACCOUNTING FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY",
            "55. Such adjustments should not be continuously used over the long term for a non-transient risk factor. If the reason for the adjustment is not expected to be temporary, such as the emergence of a new risk driver that has not previously been incorporated into the institution's allowance methodology, the methodology should be updated in the near term to incorporate the factor that is expected to have an ongoing impact on the measurement of ECL.",
            "56. The use of temporary adjustments requires the application of significant judgement and creates the potential for bias. In order to avoid the creation of potential for bias, temporary adjustments should be directionally consistent with forward-looking forecasts, supported by appropriate documentation, and subject to appropriate governance processes."

When assessing the adequacy of the allowances credit institutions should take into account relevant factors and expectations at the reporting date that may affect the collectability of remaining cash flows over the life of a group of lending exposures or a single lending exposure.

Depending on the ability to incorporate forward-looking information into the ECL estimate, credit institutions may use individual or collective assessment approaches; regardless of the assessment approach used, they should be consistent with the relevant accounting requirements and not result in materially different allowance measurements. Together, individual and collective assessments form the basis for the allowance for ECL.",
            "60. The ECL assessment approach used should be the most appropriate in the particular circumstances, and typically should be aligned with how the credit institution manages the lending exposure. For example, collective assessment is often used for large groups of homogeneous lending exposures with shared credit risk characteristics, such as retail portfolios. Individual assessments are often conducted for significant exposures, or where credit concerns have been identified at the individual loan level, such as watch list and past due loans. 30 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT INSTITUTIONS' CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND ACCOUNTING FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY",

When credit institutions use individual assessments, the ECL estimate should always incorporate the expected impact of all reasonable and supportable forward-looking information, including macroeconomic factors, that affect collectability and credit risk. When applying an individual assessment approach, in the same manner as in the case of collective assessment, the credit institution's documentation should clearly demonstrate how forward- looking information, including macroeconomic factors, has been reflected in the individual assessment.",

In cases when a credit institution's individual assessments of exposures do not adequately consider forward-looking information, and in order to allow identification of relationships between forward-looking information and ECL estimates that may not be apparent at the individual level, an institution should group lending exposures with shared credit risk characteristics to estimate the impact of forward-looking information, including macroeconomic factors. Conversely, when credit institutions determine that all reasonable and supportable forward-looking information has been incorporated in the individual assessment of ECL, an additional forward-looking assessment should not be conducted on a collective basis if that could result in double counting."

Clear roles and responsibilities for model validation with adequate independence and competence. Model validation should be performed independently of the model development process and by staff with the necessary experience and expertise. The findings and outcomes of model validation should be reported in a prompt and timely manner to the appropriate level of authority. Where a credit institution has outsourced its validation function to an external party, the credit institution remains responsible for the effectiveness of all model validation work and should ensure that the work done by the external party meets the elements of a sound model validation framework on an ongoing basis. b. An appropriate model validation scope and methodology should include a systematic process of evaluating the model's robustness, consistency and accuracy as well as its continued relevance to the underlying individual lending exposure or portfolio. An effective model validation process should also enable potential limitations of a model to be identified and addressed on a timely basis. The scope for validation should include a review of model inputs, model design and model outputs/performance. · Model inputs: Credit institutions should have internally established quality and reliability standards on data (historical, current and forward-looking information) used as model inputs. Data used to estimate ECL allowances should be relevant to the credit institutions' portfolios and, as far as possible, accurate, reliable and complete (i.e. without exclusions that could bias ECL estimates). Validation should ensure that the data used meet these standards. · Model design: For model design, validation should assess that the underlying theory of the model is conceptually sound, recognised and generally accepted for its intended purpose. From a forward-looking perspective, validation should also assess the extent to which the model, at the overall model and individual risk factor level, can take into consideration changes in the economic or credit environment, as well as changes to portfolio business profile or strategy, without significantly reducing model robustness. . Model output/performance: Credit institutions should have internally established standards for acceptable model performance. Where performance thresholds are significantly breached, remedial actions up to the extent of model re-calibration or re- development should be taken. c.

When adopting a definition of default for accounting purposes, credit institutions should be guided by the definition used for regulatory purposes provided in Article 178 of Regulation (EU) 575/201329, which includes both: a. a qualitative criterion by which 'the institution considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the institution, the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries in full, without recourse by the institution to actions such as realising security' ('unlikeliness to pay' events); and b. an objective indicator where 'the obligor is past due more than 90 days on any material credit obligation to the institution, the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries', equivalent to the rebuttable presumption in IFRS 9, paragraph B5.5.37.",

As regards the criterion in paragraph 4(b), although for regulatory purposes in the case of retail and public sector entity obligations, for the 90-day figure competent authorities may substitute a figure of up to 180 days for different products, as it considers appropriate to local conditions (see Article 178(1)(b) of Regulation (EU) 575/2013), this possibility should not be read as an exemption from the application of the 90-day rebuttable presumption in IFRS 9, paragraph B5.5.37, for those exposures."

Credit institutions should exercise experienced credit judgement to consider both qualitative and quantitative information that may affect the credit institution's assessment of credit risk. IFRS 9 provides that an entity does not need to undertake an exhaustive search for information when measuring an amount equal to 12- month ECL. However, credit institutions should actively incorporate information that may affect the estimate of ECL, and credit institutions should not exclude or ignore relevant information that is reasonably available.",

The rationale for this approach is that the creditworthiness of the counterparty, and thus the ECL anticipated upon initial recognition, is taken into account in the pricing of credit at that time. It follows, then, that a post-origination increase in credit risk may not be fully compensated by the interest rate charged, and, as a consequence, credit institutions should carefully consider whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk30. If so, the lending exposure should be subject to lifetime ECL measurement.",
            "98. In order to consider whether an exposure has suffered a significant increase in credit risk and the measurement of required 12-month ECL and lifetime ECL, credit institutions should have in place sound governance, systems and controls, in accordance with the principles specified in these guidelines. Unless already established, credit institutions should implement systems that are capable of handling and systematically assessing the large amounts of information that will be required to judge whether or not particular lending exposures or groups of lending exposures exhibit a significant increase in credit risk, and to measure lifetime ECL where that is the case. Parent undertakings and subsidiaries subject to Directive 2013/36/EU should ensure that the approach is consistent across the group. This should include, in particular, putting in place processes to ensure that forecasts of economic conditions in different jurisdictions and economic sectors are reviewed and approved by a credit institution's senior management, and that the process, controls and economic assumptions around developing forecasts and linking these to expectations of credit loss are consistent across the group. The need for consistency should not be interpreted as a requirement that the practice be identical across a group. On the contrary, within a consistent framework there may be differences across jurisdictions and products, depending for instance on the availability of data. These differences should be well documented and justified.",

In order to recognise allowances on a timely basis in line with the IFRS 9 requirements, credit institutions should: a. assemble data and forward projections for the key drivers of credit risk in their lending exposures and portfolios; and b. be able to quantify the credit risk in each of their lending exposures or portfolios based on these data and projections.",
            "102. IFRS 9, paragraph B5.5.2, states that lifetime expected credit losses are generally expected to be recognised before a financial instrument becomes past due and that 'typically, credit risk increases significantly before a financial instrument becomes past due or other lagging borrower-specific factors (for example a modification or restructuring) are observed'. Therefore, credit institutions' analyses should take into account the fact that the determinants of credit losses very often begin to deteriorate a considerable time (months or, in some cases, years) before any objective evidence of delinquency appears in the lending exposures affected. Credit institutions should be mindful that delinquency data are generally backward-looking, and will seldom on their own be appropriate in the implementation of an ECL approach. For example, within retail portfolios adverse developments in macroeconomic factors and borrower attributes will generally lead to an increase in the level of credit risk long before this manifests itself in lagging information such as delinquency.",
            "103. Thus, in order to meet the objective of IFRS 9 in a robust manner, credit institutions should also consider the linkages between macroeconomic factors and borrower attributes to the level of credit risk in a portfolio based on reasonable and supportable information. To that end, credit institutions should start with a detailed analysis of historical patterns and current trends, which would allow for identification of the most relevant credit risk drivers. Experienced credit judgement should facilitate the incorporation of current and forecasted conditions likely to affect those risk drivers, the expected cash shortfalls and therefore loss expectations.",
            "104. Credit institutions should perform analyses of this kind not only in the context of portfolios of individually small credits, such as credit card exposures, but also for large, individually managed lending exposures. For example, for a large commercial property loan, credit institutions should take account of the considerable sensitivity of the commercial property market in many jurisdictions to the general macroeconomic environment, and consider using information such as levels of interest rates or vacancy rates to determine whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk. 40 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT INSTITUTIONS' CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND ACCOUNTING FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY",
            "105. Credit institutions should have a clear policy including well-developed criteria on what constitutes a 'significant' increase in credit risk for different types of lending exposures. Such criteria and the reasons why these approaches and definitions are considered appropriate should be disclosed in accordance with IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, paragraph 35F. IFRS 9, paragraph 5.5.9, requires that, when making the assessment of significant increases in credit risk, 'an entity shall use the change in the risk of default occurring over the expected life of the financial instrument instead of the change in the amount of expected credit losses'. For these purposes, institutions should make this assessment in terms of the risk of a default occurring and not expected credit loss (i.e. before consideration of the effects of credit risk mitigants such as collateral or guarantees).",
            "106. In developing their approach to determining a significant increase in credit risk, credit institutions should consider each of the 16 classes of indicators in IFRS 9 (insofar as they are relevant to the financial instrument being assessed) as set out in paragraphs B5.5.17(a)-(p) and, in addition, credit institutions should consider whether there is further information that should be taken into account. Such indicators (in both IFRS 9 and these guidelines) should not be viewed as a 'checklist'. Some may be more relevant than others to assessing whether a particular type of lending exposure exhibits a significant increase in credit risk. At the same time, credit institutions should take particular care to avoid the risk of a significant increase in credit risk not being acknowledged promptly when it is, in fact, present. In particular, credit institutions should not restrict significant increases in credit risk to situations when a financial instrument is anticipated to become credit impaired (i.e. the third stage of IFRS 9 impairment requirements). Rather, debtors may exhibit a significant increase in credit risk without evidence that the related lending exposures are likely to become impaired. The fact that credit risk has increased significantly does not necessarily mean that default is probable - merely that it is more likely than at initial recognition. This point is underlined by the symmetry of the IFRS 9 model: it is possible for lending exposures to move to lifetime ECL but subsequently be moved back to 12-month ECL if the threshold of a significant increase in credit risk is no longer met.",
            "107. Credit institutions should consider in particular the following non-exhaustive list of indicators in assessing a significant increase in credit risk: a. a decision by the credit institution's senior management such that, if an existing lending exposure were newly originated at the reporting date, the element of the price of the lending exposure that reflects the credit risk of the exposure would be significantly higher than it was when the loan was actually originated, because of an increase in the credit risk of the specific borrower or class of borrowers since inception; b. a decision by the credit institution's senior management to strengthen collateral and/or covenant requirements for new lending exposures that are similar to lending exposures already originated, because of changes in the credit risk of those exposures since initial recognition; 41 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT INSTITUTIONS' CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND ACCOUNTING FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY c. a downgrade of a borrower by a recognised credit rating agency, or within a credit institution's internal credit rating system; d. for performing lending exposures subject to individual monitoring and review, an internal credit assessment summary/credit-quality indicator that is weaker than upon initial recognition; e. deterioration of relevant determinants of credit risk (e.g. future cash flows) for an individual obligor (or pool of obligors); and f. expectation of modification due to financial difficulties, including those qualifying as forbearance in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2015/227. While implementation of IFRS 9 should reflect credit risk management practices where possible, in some cases that would not be appropriate. If, for example, a credit institution manages most lending exposures in the same way regardless of credit risk - with the exception only of particularly strong or weak credits - the manner in which a lending exposure is managed is unlikely to be a sound indicator of whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.",
            "108. When assessing whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk for a lending exposure, credit institutions should also take into account the following factors which are related to the environment in which a credit institution or the borrower operates: a. deterioration of the macroeconomic outlook relevant to a particular borrower or to a group of borrowers. Macroeconomic assessments should be sufficiently rich to include factors relevant to sovereign, corporate, household and other types of borrower. Furthermore, they should address any relevant regional differences in economic performance within a jurisdiction 31; and b. deterioration of prospects for the sector or industries within which a borrower operates.",
            "109. Accurate identification of drivers of credit risk, and reliable demonstration of the linkages between those drivers and the level of credit risk, should be considered as critical, as a seemingly small change in a qualitative characteristic of a loan can potentially be a leading indicator of a large increase in the risk of a default occurring. Furthermore, in accordance with IFRS 9, paragraph 5.5.9, the significance of a change in credit risk since initial recognition depends on the risk of a default occurring at initial recognition. In this regard, where a credit institution uses changes in PD as a means of identifying changes in the risk of a default occurring, it should take into consideration the significance of a given change in PD expressed in a ratio (or the rate of fluctuation) proportionate to the PD at initial recognition (i.e. a change in the PD divided by the PD at initial recognition), considering also paragraph B5.5.11"

Credit institutions should look beyond how many 'grades' a rating downgrade entails because the change in PD for a one-grade movement may not be linear (for example, the default probability over five years of an exposure rated BB is around three times that of one rated BBB, based on current data and analyses applicable to certain jurisdictions). Furthermore, because the significance of a one-grade movement would depend on the granularity of a bank's rating system - and hence the 'width' of each grade - an appropriate initial segmentation should be defined to ensure that a significant increase in credit risk for an individual lending exposure or a group of lending exposures is not obscured within a segment. In this regard, credit institutions should ensure that credit risk rating systems include a sufficient number of grades to appropriately distinguish credit risk. Credit institutions should also be mindful of the fact that a significant increase in credit risk could occur prior to a movement in a credit grade.",
            "111. Credit institutions should take into account that there are some circumstances in which an adverse movement in the factors listed in paragraphs 107 and 108 above might not be indicative of a significant increase in credit risk. For example, it may be the case that the default probability of a lending exposure rated AA is low, and not much greater than one rated AAA. However, very few lending exposures are of such apparently low credit risk - and, as noted in paragraph 110, the sensitivity of default probability to rating grades may increase strongly as rating quality declines.",
            "112. Credit institutions should also be aware that there could be circumstances in which some factors move in an adverse direction but may be counterbalanced by improvement in others (see IFRS 9 Implementation Guidance, Example 2). Nonetheless, in view of the importance of detecting whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk, credit institutions should put in place governance and control processes capable of reliably validating any judgement that factors which may have an adverse impact on credit risk are counterbalanced by factors which may have a favourable impact.",
            "113. Credit institutions should give thorough consideration and full weight to discretionary decisions by a credit institution's management body or senior management which point to a change in credit risk.

            "115. Where a credit institution makes the assessment of significant increases in credit risk on a collective basis (i.e. such as retail), the definitions of portfolios should be reviewed regularly to ensure that the lending exposures within them continue to share risk characteristics in terms of their response to credit risk drivers. Changing economic conditions may require regrouping.",

In line with paragraph B5.5.1 of IFRS 9 on the assessment of significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition on a collective basis, in instances where it is apparent that, within a group of lending exposures, some lending exposures have experienced a significant increase in credit risk, credit institutions should transfer a subset or a proportion of the group of lending exposures to lifetime ECL measurement even though it is not possible to identify this on an individual lending exposure basis (see IFRS 9, Illustrative Example 5).",

Consistent with paragraph B5.5.6 of IFRS 9 and paragraph IE39 of the Implementation Guidance for IFRS 9, if it is not possible on the basis of shared credit risk characteristics to identify a particular subgroup of lending exposures for which credit risk has increased significantly, an appropriate proportion of the overall group should be subject to lifetime ECL measurement.",
            "118. 'Significant' should not be equated with statistical significance, meaning that the assessment approach should not be based solely on quantitative analysis. For portfolios which have a large number of individually small credits, and a rich set of relevant historical data, it may be possible to identify 'significant' increases in credit risk in part by using statistical techniques. However, for other lending exposures, that may not be feasible.",
            "119. 'Significant' should also not be judged in terms of the extent of impact on a credit institution's primary financial statements. Identification and disclosure of significant increases in credit risk should be undertaken, even where an increase in credit risk defined in terms of probability of default is unlikely to affect the allowance made - for example, because the exposure is more than fully collateralised - to allow credit institutions to identify and disclose such increases which are likely to be important to users seeking to understand trends in the intrinsic credit risk of a credit institution's lending exposures.",
            "120. In accordance with IFRS 9, paragraph 5.5.9, the assessment of significant increases in credit risk is based on comparing credit risk on exposures at the reporting date relative to credit risk upon initial recognition. IFRS 9, paragraph BC 5.161, and Illustrative Example 6 represent an example of the application of this principle in the Standard, rather than an exception to that principle. This example suggests that credit institutions can set a maximum credit risk for particular portfolios upon initial recognition that would lead to that portfolio moving to lifetime ECL measurement when credit risk increases beyond that maximum level. This simplification is only relevant when exposures are segmented on a sufficiently granular basis such that a credit institution can demonstrate that the analysis is consistent with the principles of IFRS 9. Specifically, credit institutions should be able to demonstrate that a 44 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT INSTITUTIONS' CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND ACCOUNTING FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY significant increase in credit risk had not occurred for items in the portfolio before the maximum credit grade was reached.",
            "121. Credit institutions should rigorously review the quality of their approach to assessing whether credit risk has increased significantly.

When determining whether there is a significant increase in credit risk for a modified lending exposure, credit institutions should be able to demonstrate, and should take into account when developing ECL estimates, whether such modifications or renegotiations have improved or restored the ability of the credit institution to collect interest and principal payments compared with the situation upon initial recognition. Consideration should also be given to the substance of modified contractual cash flows as well as the implications of the modifications for the future credit risk of the lending exposure (taking into consideration the obligor's credit risk). Factors to consider include, but are not limited to, the following: a. whether the modification or renegotiation of the contractual terms and resulting cash flows is economically beneficial to the obligor, compared with the original, unmodified contractual terms, and how the modification economically affects the obligor's ability to repay the debt; b. whether factors can be identified that support a credit institution's assessment of the obligor's ability to repay the debt, including circumstances leading up to the modification, and future prospects of the obligor as a result of the modifications, considering current conditions, macroeconomic forecasts, and prospects for the sector/industry within which the 45 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT INSTITUTIONS' CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND ACCOUNTING FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY obligor operates, the obligor's business model, and the obligor's business (management) plan that outlines the obligor's expectations of its future performance, financial resilience and cash flows; and c. whether the obligor's business plan is feasible, realisable and consistent with the repayment schedule of interest and principal under the modified contractual terms of the lending exposure.",

Lending exposures transferred to lifetime ECL that are subsequently renegotiated or modified, and not derecognised, should not move back to 12-month ECL measurement unless there is sufficient evidence that the credit risk over the life of the exposure has not increased significantly compared with that upon initial recognition. For example, where a credit institution grants various concessions such as interest rate reductions or postponements of principal repayments to obligors in financial difficulty, the lending exposure may exhibit characteristics of a lower credit risk even though in reality the obligor may continue to experience financial difficulty with no realistic prospects of making scheduled repayments over the remaining term of the exposure. In accordance with paragraph B5.5.27 of IFRS 9 'evidence that the criteria for the recognition of lifetime ECL are no longer met could include a history of up-to-date and timely payment performance against the modified contractual terms. Typically, a customer would need to demonstrate consistently good payment behaviour over a period of time before the credit risk is considered to have decreased. For example, a history of missed or incomplete payments would not typically be erased by simply making one payment on time following a modification of the contractual terms'."

            "27. IFRS 9 includes a number of practical expedients, intended to ease the implementation burden for a wide range of companies in recognition of the fact that IFRS 9 will be used by a variety of entities, including entities outside the banking industry.",
            "128. The paragraphs below address the following practical expedients: the information set which an entity must consider in measuring ECL; the exception for 'low' credit risk exposures; and the 30-days-past-due rebuttable presumption.",
            "129. Credit institutions should make limited use of those practical expedients as they have the potential to introduce significant bias and because - given their business - the cost of obtaining the relevant information is not likely to involve 'undue cost or effort'. Credit institutions should consider the need to make adjustments when using practical expedients to avoid any resulting bias, as they should take into account that the objective of IFRS 9 is to estimate expected credit losses to reflect an unbiased and probability-weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes (IFRS 9, paragraph 5.5.17).",
            "130. Where a credit institution uses such practical expedients, justifications for the use of practical expedients should be clearly documented by the credit institution. 46 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT INSTITUTIONS' CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND ACCOUNTING FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY The information set",
            "131. IFRS 9, paragraph B5.5.15, states that 'an entity shall consider reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost and effort' and that 'an entity need not undertake an exhaustive search for information when determining whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition'. Credit institutions should not read these statements restrictively and should develop systems and processes that use all reasonable and supportable information that is relevant to the group of exposures or individual exposure, as needed to achieve a high-quality, robust and consistent implementation of the accounting requirements. Nevertheless, additional cost and operational burden do not need to be introduced where they do not contribute to a high- quality implementation of IFRS 9. 'Low credit risk' exemption",
            "132. In accordance with paragraph 5.5.10 of IFRS 9, 'an entity may assume that the credit risk on a financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition if the financial instrument is determined to have a low credit risk at the reporting date'. Although credit institutions thus have the option for 'low credit risk' exposures not to assess whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, use of this exemption should be limited. In particular, credit institutions should conduct timely assessment of significant increases in credit risk for all lending exposures.",
            "133. In that context, credit institutions should always recognise changes in 12-month ECL through the allowance where there is not a significant increase in credit risk and move lending exposures to lifetime ECL measurement, if there is a significant increase in credit risk. In order to achieve a high-quality implementation of IFRS 9, any use of the low-credit-risk exemption should be accompanied by clear evidence that credit risk as of the reporting date is sufficiently low that a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition could not have occurred.",
            "134. To illustrate the meaning of low credit risk in IFRS 9, paragraph B5.5.22, IFRS 9, paragraph B5.5.23, cites as an example an instrument with an external 'investment grade' rating. However, all lending exposures that have an 'investment grade' rating from a credit rating agency cannot automatically be considered low credit risk. Credit institutions should rely primarily on their own credit risk assessments in order to evaluate the credit risk of a lending exposure, and not rely solely or mechanistically on ratings provided by credit rating agencies (where the latter are available). Nevertheless, optimistic internal credit ratings, as compared with external ratings, should require additional analysis and justification by a credit institution's management body or senior management. More-than-30-days-past-due rebuttable presumption",
            "135. Credit institutions should have credit risk assessment and management processes in place to ensure that significant credit risk increases are detected well ahead of exposures becoming 47 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT INSTITUTIONS' CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND ACCOUNTING FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY past due or delinquent. Although the use of the more-than-30-days-past-due rebuttable presumption as a backstop measure is not precluded in accordance with IFRS 9 alongside other, earlier indicators for assessing significant increase in credit risk, credit institutions should avoid using it as a primary indicator of transfer to lifetime ECL.",
            "136. Any assertion that the more-than-30-days-past-due presumption is rebutted on the basis that there has not been a significant increase in credit risk should be accompanied by a thorough analysis clearly demonstrating that 30 days past due is not correlated with a significant increase in credit risk32. Such analysis should consider both current and reasonable and supportable forward-looking information that may cause future cash shortfalls to differ from historical experience.",
            "137. In this regard, credit institutions should use relevant forward-looking information that is reasonable and supportable to analyse whether there is any substantive relationship between such information and credit risk drivers. Credit institutions should not use the 30-days-past- due rebuttable presumption unless they have demonstrated that the forward-looking information had no substantive relationship with the credit risk driver or such information is not available without undue cost or effort.",
            "138. . In the limited instances where past-due information is the best criterion available to a credit institution to determine when exposures should move to the lifetime ECL category, credit institutions should pay particular attention to their measurement of 12-month ECL allowance to ensure that ECL are appropriately captured in accordance with the measurement objective of IFRS 9. Moreover, credit institutions should take into account that significant reliance on backward-looking information will introduce bias into the implementation of an ECL accounting model and that they should ensure that the objectives of the IFRS 9 impairment requirements (i.e. to reflect ECL that meet the stated measurement objectives and to capture all significant increases in credit risk) are met."

Feedback on the public consultation 64 2 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Executive Summary In recent years, internal governance issues have received increased attention from various international bodies. Their main aim has been to correct institutions' weak or superficial internal governance practices, as identified during the financial crisis. Recently, there has been a greater focus on conduct-related shortcomings and activities in offshore financial centres. Sound internal governance arrangements are fundamental if institutions individually and the banking system they form are to operate well. Directive 2013/36/EU reinforces the governance requirements for institutions and in particular stresses the responsibility of the management body for sound governance arrangements; the importance of a strong supervisory function that challenges management decision-making; and the need to establish and implement a sound risk strategy and risk management framework. To further harmonise institutions' internal governance arrangements, processes and mechanisms within the EU in line with the requirements introduced by Directive 2013/36/EU, the European Banking Authority (EBA) is mandated by Article 74 of Directive 2013/36/EU to develop guidelines in this area. The guidelines apply to all institutions regardless of their governance structures (unitary board, dual board or other structure), without advocating or preferring any specific structure, as set out specifically in the scope of application. The terms 'management body in its management function' and 'management body in its supervisory function' should be interpreted throughout the guidelines in accordance with the applicable law within each Member State. The guidelines complete the various governance provisions in Directive 2013/36/EU, taking into account the principle of proportionality, by specifying the tasks, responsibilities and organisation of the management body, and the organisation of institutions, including the need to create transparent structures that allow for supervision of all their activities; the guidelines also specify requirements aimed at ensuring the sound management of risks across all three lines of defence and, in particular, set out detailed requirements for the second line of defence (the independent risk management and compliance function) and the third line of defence (the internal audit function). The guidelines are based on an earlier set of guidelines on internal governance and in particular add additional requirements that aim to foster a sound risk culture implemented by the management body, to strengthen the management body's oversight of the institution's activities and to strengthen the risk management frameworks of institutions. Additional guidelines have been provided to further increase the transparency of institutions' offshore activities and to ensure the consideration of risks within institutions' change processes. 3 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Next steps The EBA has published its guidelines on internal governance, which will enter into force on 30 June 2018. The existing guidelines on internal governance, published on 27 September 2011, will be repealed at the same time. On the same date, the EBA and ESMA joint guidelines on the assessment of the suitability of members of the management body and key function holders will come into force. 4 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Background and rationale",
            "1. Trust in the reliability of the financial system is crucial for its proper functioning and a prerequisite if it is to contribute to the economy as a whole. Consequently, effective internal governance arrangements are fundamental if institutions individually and the banking system they form are to operate well.",
            "2. In recent years, internal governance issues have received increased attention from various international bodies. Their main aim has been to correct institutions' weak or superficial internal governance practices, as identified during the financial crisis. These faulty practices, while not a direct trigger for the financial crisis, were closely associated with it and were questionable. In addition, recently, there has been a greater focus on conduct-related shortcomings and activities in offshore financial centres.",
            "3. In some cases, at the time of the financial crisis the absence of effective checks and balances within institutions resulted in a lack of effective oversight of management decision-making, which led to short-term oriented and excessively risky management strategies. Weak oversight by the management body in its supervisory function has been identified as a contributing factor. The management body, both in its management function and, in particular, in its supervisory function, might not have understood the complexity of the business and the risks involved, consequently failing to identify and constrain excessive risk- taking in an effective manner.",
            "4. Internal governance frameworks, including internal control mechanisms and risk management, were often not sufficiently integrated within institutions or groups. There was a lack of a uniform methodology and terminology, so that a holistic view of all risks did not exist. Internal control functions often lacked appropriate resources, status and/or expertise.",
            "5. Conversely, sound internal governance practices helped some institutions to manage the financial crisis significantly better than others. These practices included the setting of an appropriate risk strategy and appropriate risk appetite levels, a holistic risk management framework and effective reporting lines to the management body.",
            "6. Against this background, there is a clear need to address the potentially detrimental effects of poorly designed internal governance arrangements on the sound management of risk, to ensure effective oversight by the management body, in particular in its supervisory function, to promote a sound risk culture at all levels of institutions and to enable competent authorities to supervise and monitor the adequacy of internal governance arrangements. 5 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Legal basis",
            "7. To further harmonise institutions' internal governance arrangements, processes and mechanisms within the EU, the EBA is mandated by Article 74 of Directive 2013/36/EU to develop guidelines in this area.",
            "8. Article 74 of Directive 2013/36/EU requires institutions to have robust governance arrangements, including a clear organisational structure with well-defined, transparent and consistent lines of responsibility.",
            "9. Article 76 of Directive 2013/36/EU sets out requirements for the involvement of the management body in risk management, the setting up of a risk committee for significant institutions, and the tasks and organisation of the risk management function. In addition, this Article establishes 'that the head of the risk management function shall be an independent senior management with distinct responsibility for the risk management function'. To reflect the wording of the Directive, the revised guidelines refer, regarding the second line of defence, to the '(independent) risk management function', while the previous guidelines used the term '(independent) risk control function'. However, it should be remembered that business lines or units, as the first line of defence, have a material role in ensuring robust risk management and compliance within an institution.",
            "10. Article 88 of Directive 2013/36/EU sets out the responsibilities of the management body regarding governance arrangements and the obligation to set up a nomination committee for significant institutions.",
            "11. Under Article 109(1) of Directive 2013/36/EU, competent authorities must require institutions to meet the obligations set out in Articles 74 to 96 of that Directive on an individual basis, unless competent authorities make use of the derogations as defined in Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and/or waivers for institutions permanently affiliated to a central body in compliance with Article 21 of Directive 2013/36/EU.",
            "12. Article 109(2) of Directive 2013/36/EU requires parent undertakings and subsidiaries subject to this Directive to meet the governance requirements also on a consolidated or sub- consolidated basis, to ensure that their arrangements, processes and mechanisms are consistent and well-integrated and that any data and information relevant to the purpose of supervision can be produced. In particular, it should be ensured that parent undertakings and subsidiaries subject to this Directive implement such arrangements, processes and mechanisms in their subsidiaries not subject to this Directive. These arrangements, processes and mechanisms must also be consistent and well-integrated and those subsidiaries not subject to this Directive must also be able to produce any data and information relevant to the purpose of supervision.",
            "13. According to Article 109(3) of Directive 2013/36/EU, the requirement under Article 109(2) of this Directive to ensure the application of Articles 74 to 96 of the Directive also in 6 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY subsidiaries not subject to this Directive does not apply only if the EU parent institution can demonstrate that application is unlawful under the law of the third country.",
            "14. Under Article 123(2) of Directive 2013/36/EU, competent authorities must require institutions to have in place adequate risk management processes and internal control mechanisms, including sound reporting and accounting procedures in order to identify, measure, monitor and control transactions with their parent mixed-activity holding company and its subsidiaries appropriately.",
            "15. In line with Article 47 of Directive 2013/36/EU, branches in a Member State of credit institutions authorised in a third country should be subject to equivalent requirements to those applicable to institutions within the Member State where the branch is located, taking into account regarding internal governance arrangements that the branch does not have a management body but persons who are responsible for effectively directing the business.",
            "16. The guidelines should be read in conjunction with and without prejudice to the guidelines on sound remuneration policies (EBA/GL/2015/22) and the joint guidelines on the assessment of the suitability of members of the management body and key function holders. The existing guidelines on internal governance, published on 27 September 2011, will be repealed when the new guidelines enter into force.",
            "17. These guidelines should be read in conjunction with other relevant EBA products, including the CEBS guidelines on outsourcing arrangements and the EBA guidelines on the supervisory review process and the EBA guidelines on disclosures. Rationale and objective of the guidelines",
            "18. Internal governance includes all standards and principles concerned with setting an institution's objectives, strategies and risk management framework; how its business is organised; how responsibilities and authority are defined and clearly allocated; how reporting lines are set up and what information they convey; and how the internal control framework is organised and implemented, including accounting procedures and remuneration policies. Internal governance also encompasses sound information technology systems, outsourcing arrangements and business continuity management.",
            "19. Directive 2013/36/EU sets out requirements aimed at remedying weaknesses that were identified during the financial crisis regarding internal governance arrangements and in particular the sound management and oversight of risks. Identified weaknesses included in particular a lack of effective oversight by the management body, in particular in its supervisory function, limited accessability of the supervisory function and shortcomings regarding the authority, stature and resources of the risk management function. 7 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY",
            "20. In addition, it is also necessary to take into account developments in this area since the publication of the EBA guidelines on internal governance in 2011, such as the updated OECD principles of corporate governance1 and the revised corporate governance principles for banks published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)2. The guidelines align the terminology used regarding risk appetite and risk tolerance with the EBA guidelines on common procedures and methodologies for the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP) (EBA/GL/2014/13) and also with the revised BCBS principles; they use the term 'risk appetite' to refer to the aggregate level of risk and the types of risk an institution is willing to assume, while 'risk capacity' is the maximum amount of risk an institution is able to assume.",
            "21. The guidelines are intended to apply to all existing board structures without interfering with the general allocation of competences in accordance with national company law or advocating any particular structure. Accordingly, they should be applied irrespective of the board structure used (a unitary and/or a dual board structure and/or another structure) across Member States. The management body, as defined in points (7) and (8) of Article 3(1) of Directive 2013/36/EU, should be understood as having management (executive) and supervisory (non-executive) functions.",
            "22. The terms 'management body in its management function' and 'management body in its supervisory function' are used throughout these guidelines without referring to any specific governance structure, and references to the management (executive) or supervisory (non- executive) function should be understood as applying to the bodies or members of the management body responsible for that function in accordance with national law.",
            "23. In Member States where the management body delegates, partially or fully, the executive function to a person or an internal executive body (e.g. a chief executive officer (CEO), management team or executive committee), the persons who perform those executive functions on the basis of that delegation should be understood as constituting the management function of the management body. For the purposes of these guidelines, any reference to the management body in its management function should be understood as including also the members of the executive body or the CEO, as defined in these guidelines, even if they have not been proposed or appointed as formal members of the institution's governing body or bodies under national law.",
            "24. The management body is empowered to set the institution's strategy, objectives and overall direction, and oversees and monitors management decision-making. The management body in its management function directs the institution. Senior management is accountable to the management body for the day-to-day running of the institution.

Taking into consideration all existing governance structures provided for by national laws, competent authorities should ensure the effective and consistent application of the guidelines in their jurisdictions in accordance with the rationale and objectives of the guidelines themselves. For this purpose, competent authorities may clarify the governing bodies and functions to which the tasks and responsibilities set forth in the guidelines pertain, when this is appropriate to ensure the proper application of the guidelines in accordance with the governance structures provided for under national company law.",

            "27. With regard to the composition of committees and the requirement to have independent members, the guidelines are in line with the BCBS principles on corporate governance, which set out guidance for the largest institutions.

            "29. The business lines, as the first line of defence, take risks and are responsible for their operational management directly and on a permanent basis. For that purpose, business lines should have appropriate processes and controls in place that aim to ensure that risks are identified, analysed, measured, monitored, managed, reported and kept within the limits of the institution's risk appetite and that the business activities are in compliance with external and internal requirements.",
            "30. The risk management function and compliance function form the second line of defence. The risk management function (referred to in the previous guidelines as the 'risk control function') facilitates the implementation of a sound risk management framework throughout the institution and has responsibility for further identifying, monitoring, analysing, measuring, managing and reporting on risks and forming a holistic view on all risks on an individual and consolidated basis. It challenges and assists in the implementation of risk management measures by the business lines in order to ensure that the process and controls in place at the first line of defence are properly designed and effective.

The independent internal audit function, as the third line of defence, conducts risk-based and general audits and reviews the internal governance arrangements, processes and mechanisms to ascertain that they are sound and effective, implemented and consistently applied. The internal audit function is in charge also of the independent review of the first two lines of defence. The internal audit function performs its tasks fully independently of the other lines of defence.",
            "32. To ensure their proper functioning, all internal control functions need to be independent of the business they control, have the appropriate financial and human resources to perform their tasks, and report directly to the management body. Within all three lines of defence, appropriate internal control procedures, mechanisms and processes should be designed, developed, maintained and evaluated under the ultimate responsibility of the management body.",

The guidelines specify requirements under Directive 2013/36/EU that need to be considered when setting up new structures, e.g. in offshore financial centres, and which aim to increase the transparency of and reduce the risks connected with such activities. Guidelines are also provided regarding the reporting of institutions on governance arrangements, including in relation to such structures.",
            "35. The guidelines aim to establish a sound risk culture in institutions. Risks should be taken within a well-defined framework in line with the institution's risk strategy and appetite. This includes the establishment of and ensuring compliance with a system of limits and controls. Risks within new products and business areas, but also risks that may result from changes to institutions' products, processes and systems, are to be duly identified, assessed, appropriately managed and monitored. The risk management function and compliance function should be involved in the establishment of the framework and the approval of such changes to ensure that all material risks are taken into account and that the institution complies with all internal and external requirements.",

The methodologies should allow for the aggregation of risk exposures across business lines and support the identification of risk concentrations. The tools should include the assessment of the actual risk profile against the institution's risk appetite, as well as the identification and assessment of potential and stressed risk exposures under a range of assumed adverse circumstances against the institution's risk capacity. The tools should provide information on 43 GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY any adjustment to the risk profile that may be required. Institutions should make appropriately conservative assumptions when building stressed scenarios.",
            "141. Institutions should take into consideration that the results of quantitative assessment methodologies, including stress testing, are highly dependent on the limitations and assumptions of the models (including the severity and duration of the shock and the underlying risks). For example, models showing very high returns on economic capital may result from a weakness in the models (e.g. the exclusion of some relevant risks) rather than a superior strategy or excellent execution of a strategy on the part of the institution. The determination of the level of risk taken should not therefore be based only on quantitative information or model outputs; it should also comprise a qualitative approach (including expert judgement and critical analysis). Relevant macroeconomic environmental trends and data should be explicitly addressed to identify their potential impact on exposures and portfolios.",

The ultimate responsibility for risk assessment lies solely with the institution, which, accordingly, should evaluate its risks critically and should not rely exclusively on external assessments. For example, an institution should validate a purchased risk model and calibrate it to its own individual circumstances to ensure that the model accurately and comprehensively captures and analyses the risk.",

Regular and transparent reporting mechanisms should be established so that the management body, its risk committee, where established, and all relevant units in an institution are provided with reports in a timely, accurate, concise, understandable and meaningful manner and can share relevant information about the identification, measurement or assessment, monitoring and management of risks. The reporting framework should be well defined and documented.",

Effective communication and awareness regarding risks and the risk strategy is crucial for the whole risk management process, including the review and decision-making processes, and helps prevent decisions that may unknowingly increase risk.

The objective of the definition of 'connected clients' in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 is to identify clients so closely linked by idiosyncratic risk factors that it is prudent to treat them as a single risk. Idiosyncratic risk represents the effect of risks that are specific to individual clients. Idiosyncratic risk arises where, in a bilateral interrelationship, financial problems of one entity are transferred via this interrelationship to another entity that otherwise would not be concerned. Consequently, the purpose of these guidelines is to clarify and operationalise the concept of interconnection, in particular when control issues or economic dependency should lead to the grouping of clients because they constitute a single risk in accordance with Article 4(1)(39) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.",

            "6. The reasoning behind the current guidelines is that where a control relationship exists the controlling person/entity has legally enforceable rights that establish a strong form of financial dependency on the controlling person/entity by the controlled entity. In case of financial problems of the controlling person/entity, it is highly likely that the controlling person/entity could make use of its rights to extract capital and/or liquidity from the controlled entity, thereby weakening the financial position of the latter. Financial problems could be transferred to the controlled entity, with the result that both the controlling person/entity and the controlled entity would experience financial problems ('domino effect'). From the perspective of prudential risk stemming from exposures to clients, it is therefore appropriate to attach the strong assumption of a single risk to a relationship of control between different clients.",
            "7. The definition of 'control' in Article 4(1)(37) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 points to the accounting definition of the relationship between a parent undertaking and a subsidiary, as defined in the new Accounting Directive 2013/34/EU6 or the accounting standards to which an institution is subject under Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002,7 or a similar relationship between any natural or legal person and an undertaking. Therefore, where the new Accounting Directive 2013/34/EU is applicable, it has an impact on the way institutions assess control relationships for the purposes of grouping connected clients. 6 Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on the annual financial statements, consolidated financial statements and related reports of certain types of undertakings, amending Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC. 7 Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 July 2002 on the application of international accounting standards. 7 GUIDELINES ON CONNECTED CLIENTS EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY",
            "8. Article 22(1) and (2) of Directive 2013/34/EU sets out several options and national discretions for Member States as regards the transposition of such provisions, thus leaving the definition of 'group' for the purpose of consolidation of accounts to the Member States. Consequently, the definition of 'control' for the purpose of forming groups of connected clients will also depend on the national transposition of these options and national discretions. The present guidelines regarding the 'control' criterion respect the national transpositions of Directive 2013/34/EU, which may potentially lead to different grouping requirements depending on where institutions' clients are required to prepare their consolidated financial statements.",
            "9. These guidelines clarify that institutions should make use of their clients' consolidated financial statements8 when assessing connections based on control. For clients to which the EU accounting rules do not apply (e.g. natural persons, central governments and clients that prepare consolidated accounts in accordance with the accounting rules of a third country), the guidelines provide a non-exhaustive list of criteria and indicators of control. This list is divided into two different sets: the first set consists of criteria that always constitute a control relationship among clients; the second set includes examples of indicators that should be considered by institutions in their assessment, as any of these indicators might constitute a control relationship among clients.",
            "10.In addition, the guidelines clarify the concept of 'single risk' and also that the burden of proof is on the institution to demonstrate that, despite the existence of a control relationship among clients, those clients, by way of exception, do not constitute a single risk.",
            "11.Finally, it is noted that the assessment of control relationships is only the first step in the assessment of the connections among clients, before assessing any potential economic dependency."

Where a central government has direct control over or is directly interconnected with more than one natural or legal person, the specification 'including the central government' for the alternative approach should be understood as always requiring the inclusion of the central government in each of the groups of connected clients identified separately for the natural or legal persons directly controlled by or directly interconnected with the central government.",

            "20.Even if the issue of control of one client over another does not apply, institutions are obliged to assess whether there exists a relationship of economic dependency among clients. If it is likely that the financial problems of one client would cause difficulties for the other(s) in terms of full and timely repayment of liabilities, there exists an idiosyncratic risk that needs to be addressed by considering the clients to be connected. An economic dependency among clients may be mutual or only one way.",
            "21.Dependency might arise in the context of business interconnections (e.g. supply chain links, dependence on large customers or counterparty exposures, financial dependency) that are not linked to sectorial or geographical risks, and it suggests that the clients involved are exposed to the same idiosyncratic risk factor. If this idiosyncratic risk materialises, one or both obligors are likely to experience repayment difficulties. Consequently, interconnections among entities (or persons) due to bilateral business relationships may lead to contagion risk that is independent of sectorial or geographical risks. The fact that the existence of common idiosyncratic risk factors may lead to contagion risk for otherwise independent clients is at the core of the concept of economic interconnection.",
            "22.The rationale for the definition of economic interconnection in Article 4(1)(39)(b) is to identify channels of contagion stemming from economic dependencies that a client cannot overcome without experiencing repayment difficulties. However, even if a client is dependent on another client through, for instance, a business relationship, it could still be possible for the client to easily find a replacement for this business partner (in case of its default), or to compensate for such a loss by other means, for example through reduction of costs or concentration on other sectors. This might cause practical problems, such as lower margins, but if an institution is able to demonstrate that it would not lead to repayment difficulties, there is no requirement to consider such clients as interconnected.",
            "23.It should be noted that a common source of funding due solely to geographical location does not, in itself, lead to a requirement to connect clients. Small and medium-sized entities will, in many cases, not have the capacity or commercial incentive to use institutions other than their local bank, and, in addition, for most of them the personal relationship with their banker is the key to better financial services. This fact does not in itself justify these clients being regarded as interconnected, even though they have a common source of funding (i.e. the reporting institution itself). Such funding dependencies differ from the funding dependencies described in these guidelines because the common source of funding is the result of the geographical location and can normally be replaced.",
            "24. Clients that depend on their existing source of funding simply because they are not creditworthy do not belong in this category. In the same way, being clients of the same institution does not in itself create a requirement to group the clients if the institution providing funding can be easily replaced. Institutions are not required to collect information about whether their clients share an 10 GUIDELINES ON CONNECTED CLIENTS EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY external common source of funding; however, institutions do need to take into account available information in this regard.",
            "25.Although these guidelines apply to exposures to shadow banking entities10 in the same way that they apply to exposures to other clients, the institution should pay particular attention when assessing connections among shadow banking entities. The EBA 'Guidelines on limits on exposures to shadow banking entities' define prudential expectations regarding groups of shadow banking entities. In this context, institutions should give due consideration to the fact that elements of control among these shadow banking entities will most likely consist not of equity ties but rather of a different type of relationship, i.e. situations of de facto control or relationships characterised by contractual obligations, implicit support or potential reputational risk (e.g. sponsorship or even branding). 11"

However, there are situations where the two types of dependencies are interlinked and could therefore exist within one group of connected clients in such a way that all relevant clients constitute a single risk. The wording in point (b) of Article 4(1)(39) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, 'between whom there is no relationship of control', does not lead to two mutually exclusive grouping requirements. It should rather be understood as meaning that the control relationship is a grouping requirement due to a very strong form of dependency (control as legal dependency) and thus is a subcategory of the wider form of economic dependency. The overarching indicator is the same in both cases, i.e. a single risk between two or more clients ('domino effect'), regardless of the type of connection the single risk is based on. The chain of contagion leading to possible default of all entities concerned is the relevant factor for the grouping and needs to be assessed in each individual case.",

In this regard, institutions should have in place a robust process for investigating and identifying connections among clients. To this end, institutions should take reasonable steps to collect and use all relevant information; this includes publicly available information, information beyond the institutions' clients and also 'soft information' that typically exists at the level of individual loan officers and relationship managers.",

The guidelines acknowledge, however, the inherent difficulty of identifying economic dependencies among clients and state that institutions should strengthen their investigations in all cases where the sum of all exposures to one individual client exceeds 5% of Tier 1 capital.",
            "31.It is important to note that institutions should also collect information on all entities forming a 'chain of contagion' to be able to correctly identify groups of connected clients. However, if there are interconnections among entities with which the institution has no business relation (and thus has not collected any information with regard to possible interconnections), the correct identification of a group of connected clients might not be possible. Naturally, if an institution becomes aware of such interconnections via entities outside its clientele (e.g. through press statements), it needs to incorporate this information into its grouping practice.",

As the determination of economic interconnection is dependent on the one hand on the information available to or gathered by the institution and on the other hand on economic judgement, it is possible that different institutions will arrive at different results when analysing the same entities.

Although the joint efforts of banks, supervisors, regulators and macroprudential authorities have led to a slow improvement in NPE ratios in recent years, the overall level of NPEs remains high by historic standards, especially in some jurisdictions. In July 2017, the European Council concluded an Action Plan1 to tackle non- performing loans (NPLs) in Europe. The Council stressed that a comprehensive approach consisting of a mix of complementary policy actions, at national and European level, was needed to address the existing stock of NPLs as well as to prevent the emergence and accumulation of new NPEs on banks' balance sheets. In this regard, the EBA, along with other bodies and institutions, was invited by the Council to contribute to this Action Plan in four specific areas: (i) supervisory actions to work with banks to improve strategies to reduce NPEs; (ii) measures to improve the functioning of the secondary market; (iii) structural measures to improve the environment for dealing with NPEs; and (iv) fostering restructuring of the banking system. These guidelines relate to the first area. The guidelines are aimed primarily at reducing NPEs on banks' balance sheets by providing supervisory guidance to ensure that credit institutions effectively manage NPEs and forborne exposures (FBEs) on their balance sheets. The aim is to achieve a sustainable reduction of NPEs on credit institutions' balance sheets by means of the institutions' own NPE strategies, which would prove beneficial from both micro and macro perspectives. The guidelines are written from a prudential perspective but also taking into account the pressing need to ensure that consumers who have taken out loans are treated fairly at every stage of the loan life cycle. To that end, the guidelines draw attention specifically to provisions under the EU directives and relevant EBA guidelines relating to consumers of which credit institutions need to be cognisant when managing NPEs. The development and operationalisation of an NPE strategy is the core building block of the guidelines for banks' NPE management. The NPE strategy should be built on an assessment of the operating environment, should set out time-bound, credible yet ambitious reduction targets and should consider all available strategic options to reduce NPEs. The guidelines outline the proportionate approach to the key elements of governance and operations in relation to an NPE workout framework, covering aspects related to steering and decision-making, the NPE operating model, the internal control framework and NPE monitoring processes. Credit institutions with gross NPL ratios at a level of 5% or above should establish an NPE strategy, as part of their overall strategy, and related governance and operational arrangements. Effective governance covers all the responsibilities that banks have, including treating customers fairly. The guidelines stress that any forbearance measures should be granted only when they aim to restore sustainable repayment by the borrower and are thus in the borrower's interests. These"

            "1. The financial crisis negatively affected the European banking sector in various ways, and it contributed to the build-up of a large stock of non-performing exposures (NPEs) on banks' balance sheets. The stock of non-performing loans (NPLs) in the EU banking sector amounted to EUR 989 billion at the end of 2016, EUR 815 billion at the end of 2017 and EUR 779 billion in the first quarter of 2018, i.e. 5.4%, 4.1% and 3.9% respectively of the total loan portfolio. The EU average NPE ratio was 3.4% in the first quarter of 2018.2",
            "2. The dispersion of the stock of NPEs is uneven across Member States. There are currently 12 Member States experiencing above average NPE ratios, and the scale and the cross-border implications make this an EU-wide problem. The overall level remains high by historic standards, even though the joint efforts of banks, supervisors and macroprudential authorities have led to a slow improvement in NPE ratios over recent years.",
            "3. The EBA's risk analysis, supported by similar research conducted by other international organisations, indicated that high levels of NPEs are a drag on profitability and are strongly correlated with weak lending growth. The effects of high levels of NPEs on banks' balance sheets on, inter alia, funding costs and capital and profitability can seriously jeopardise institutions' ability to run a viable and sustainable business model.",
            "4. NPEs are a problem at multiple levels: at microprudential level, high levels of NPEs are associated with lower profitability and lower efficiency; at macroprudential level, high levels of NPEs are connected with stagnant growth, as capital is tied up in NPEs and there is decreased new lending into the real economy. In addition, high stocks of NPEs negatively affect the resilience of the banking sector to shocks and hence increase systemic risk. Finally, for consumers, an inability to meet the obligations of the credit contract could have a detrimental impact on their financial situation and social circumstances. All of these effects must be tackled in a comprehensive manner.",
            "5. In 2014, in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 on supervisory reporting the EBA introduced definitions of NPEs and forborne exposures (FBEs) to facilitate the identification of problematic assets. Despite the decreasing trend in levels of NPEs in most EU Member States, the pace of reduction of NPLs has been slow. This slow pace of reduction is mainly due to the discretion allowed banks' management and supervisors, together with the absence of an effective secondary market for NPEs and challenging legal systems, which have incentivised credit institutions to keep the loans on their balance sheets."

Section 6 sets out supervisory expectations regarding the use of forbearance, section 7 addresses the recognition of NPEs, section 8 deals with NPE impairments and write-offs, and section 9 specifies supervisory requirements regarding the collateral valuation of movable and immovable property. Furthermore, section 10 provides guidance to the competent authorities on addressing NPEs and FBEs in the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP).",
            "8. The NPE strategy is the core building block of the guidelines for the banks' NPE management. The strategy sets the basis for the credit institutions' initial and regular assessments of the operating environment and describes the considerations that they should take into account. These include the internal capabilities of the credit institution, external conditions and capital implications. When developing their NPE strategy, credit institutions should also consider all available strategic options and combinations of them. These include hold/forbearance strategies, active portfolio reductions, taking collateral onto the balance sheet and legal options including out-of-court options. Furthermore, implementing the operational plan and embedding the NPE strategy into the institution are both important aspects of the NPE strategy. The guidelines call for regular review of the strategy, monitoring of its operational effectiveness and integration of it into the credit institution's risk management framework.",

The level of a 5% gross NPL ratio aims to ensure a minimum level of transparency, and to ensure that credit institutions are prepared to prevent NPEs building up and to take action at an early stage to tackle the issue. The rationale behind applying an NPL threshold is that the majority of exposures on credit institutions' balance sheets that have become non- performing are loans; therefore, a calculation that is based on the share of NPLs better depicts the evolution of asset quality overall and is more risk based.

            "71.Credit institutions should consider the following phases in the NPE life cycle, taking into account also the specificities of the products and the nature of the arrears: a) Early arrears (up to 90 days past due):23 during this phase, the focus should be on initial engagement with the borrower for early recoveries and on collecting information to enable a detailed assessment of the borrower's circumstances (e.g. financial position, status of loan documentation, status of collateral, level of cooperation, etc.). The type of exposure and collateral should ultimately determine the most suitable workout strategy, which may involve forbearance measures with a short-term time horizon, to be applied when necessary (including during this initial period, where appropriate), with the aim of stabilising the financial position of the borrower before establishing a suitable workout strategy. In addition, the credit institution should, where appropriate, seek options to improve its position while taking into account the rights and interests of consumers (e.g. by signing new loan documents, perfecting outstanding collateral, minimising cash leakage, taking additional collateral if available). A dedicated arrears management policy should contain guidance on the overall NPE workout procedures and responsibilities, including handover triggers. b) Late arrears/forbearance: credit institutions should implement and formalise forbearance arrangements with borrowers in this phase. Forbearance arrangements should be put into place only where the credit institution is satisfied that the borrower can afford to make the repayments. In considering whether a restructuring option is viable, credit institutions should have regard to Article 28 of Directive 2014/17/EU24 and other legal provisions aimed at protecting consumers, to the extent applicable. A forbearance arrangement should be monitored for at least one year in line with Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014, given the increased risk, before it can eventually be transferred out of the NPE WUs if no further NPE triggers are observed."

These controls should include, at a minimum, that such cases are explicitly brought to the attention of the risk control function ex ante. Furthermore, the explicit approval of the relevant senior decision-making body should be sought. d) Forbearance measures with a short-term time horizon are applied temporarily and the credit institution is able to demonstrate, based on objectively verifiable evidence, that the borrower has the ability to repay the original or modified amount on a full principal and interest basis commencing from the expiry date of the short-term temporary arrangement. e) The measure does not result in multiple consecutive forbearance measures having been granted to the same exposure.",

In addition, credit institutions should pay attention to the requirements for valuing cash flow under IFRS 13 on fair value measurements. In particular, financial institutions should comply with the following requirements: a) They must determine the assumed time of disposal taking into account current and expected market conditions as well as the underlying national legal framework regarding the disposal of mortgaged properties. b) They must ensure that the property price used to determine the estimated market value of property collateral at the point of liquidation is not based on macroeconomic projections/assumptions that are more optimistic than the projections produced by the relevant authorities and organisations such as International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European System of Central Banks (ESCB)/ the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), and therefore does not assume an improvement on the current market conditions. 55 FINAL REPORT - GUIDELINES ON MANAGEMENT OF NON-PERFORMING AND FORBORNE EXPOSURES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY c) They must ensure that income from property collateral is not assumed to increase from the current levels unless there is an existing contractual arrangement for such an increase. Moreover, current income from property should be adjusted when calculating cash flow in order to reflect the expected economic conditions. Credit institutions should consider whether it is appropriate to project a flat income in a recessionary environment in which vacant properties are increasing and/or demand for transportation is decreasing, putting downwards pressure on income. d) A hold strategy on property collateral is not acceptable.

The assumptions made in order to measure this adjustment may be documented, and should be available to the supervisor on request. Illiquidity discounts may be considered.",

Feedback on the public consultation and opinion of the Banking Stakeholder Group 63 2 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE UNDER DIRECTIVE (EU) 2019/2034 EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Executive summary For several years now, internal governance issues have received increased attention from various international bodies. Their main aim has been to correct financial institutions' weak or superficial internal governance practices, including compliance with the framework to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing, as the reinforcement of internal governance arrangements is a critical issue for the sustainable growth of market-based financing. Sound internal governance arrangements are fundamental if investment firms are to operate well as part of the financial system. Directive (EU) 2019/2034 sets out governance requirements for investment firms and, in particular, stresses the responsibility of the management body to ensure sound governance arrangements, the importance of a strong supervisory function that challenges management's decision-making and the need to establish and implement a sound risk strategy, risk appetite, risk culture and risk management framework. To further harmonise investment firms' internal governance arrangements, processes and mechanisms within the EU, in line with the requirements introduced by Directive (EU) 2019/2034, the European Banking Authority (EBA) is mandated by Article 26(4) of Directive (EU) 2019/2034 to develop guidelines in this area. The guidelines apply to investment firms as defined in Article 4(1)(1) of Directive (EU) 2014/65 that do not meet all of the conditions for qualifying as small and non- interconnected investment firms under Article 12(1) of Regulation (EU) 2019/2033. These requirements apply regardless of the investment firms' governance structures (unitary board, dual board or other structure). However, the guidelines do not advocate or prefer any specific structure. The terms 'management body in its management function' and 'management body in its supervisory function' should be interpreted in accordance with the applicable law within each Member State. The guidelines complete the various governance provisions in Directive (EU) 2019/2034, taking into account the principle of proportionality, by specifying the tasks, responsibilities and functioning of the management body, and the organisation of investment firms, including the need to create transparent structures that allow for the supervision of all their activities. The guidelines also specify in more detail the requirements under Directive (EU) 2019/2034 and aim to ensure the sound management of all risks. Risks need to be managed across all three lines of defence. While the business needs to manage its risks, the guidelines stress the responsibilities of the second line of defence (the independent risk management and compliance function) and also the third line of defence (the internal audit function). The guidelines are consistent with the guidelines on internal governance for credit institutions and with international standards and, in particular, set out provisions that aim to foster a sound risk culture to be implemented by the management body, strengthening the management body's oversight of the investment firm's activities and implementing a sound risk management framework. 3 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE UNDER DIRECTVIE (EU) 2019/2034 EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Background and rationale",
            "1. Trust in the reliability of the financial system is crucial for its proper functioning and a prerequisite if it is to contribute to the economy as a whole. Consequently, effective internal governance arrangements are fundamental to the sustainable growth of market-based funding.",
            "2. In recent years, internal governance issues have received increased attention from various international bodies1. Their main aim has been to correct financial institutions' weak or superficial internal governance practices, as identified during the financial crisis and during ongoing supervision by competent authorities. In addition, there has recently been a greater focus on conduct-related shortcomings and activities in offshore financial centres, and in the area of money laundering and terrorist financing.",
            "3. In some cases, the absence of effective checks and balances within financial institutions resulted in a lack of effective oversight of management decision-making, which led to short- term and excessively risky management strategies. Weak oversight by the management body in its supervisory function has been identified as a contributing factor. The management body, both in its management function and, in particular, in its supervisory function, might not have understood the complexity of the business and the risks involved. Consequently, these bodies failed to identify and constrain excessive risk-taking in an effective manner.",
            "4. Internal governance frameworks, including internal control mechanisms and risk management, were often not sufficiently integrated within financial institutions or groups. These functions were not regarded as a high priority, which impacted the stability of markets as a result. In many investment firms there was a lack of a uniform risk methodology and terminology, which meant that there was no holistic view of all risks. Internal control functions often lacked appropriate resources, status and/or expertise.",
            "5. Conversely, sound internal governance practices helped some financial institutions to manage the financial crisis significantly better than others. These practices included the setting of an appropriate risk strategy and appropriate risk appetite levels, a holistic risk management framework and effective reporting lines to the management body.",
            "6. Against this backdrop, there is a clear need to address the potentially detrimental effects of poorly designed internal governance arrangements on the sound management of risk, to ensure effective oversight by the management body, in particular in its supervisory function, to promote a sound risk culture at all levels of investment firms and to enable competent authorities to supervise and monitor the adequacy of internal governance arrangements."

            "8. Article 26 (1) of Directive (EU) 2019/2034 requires investment firms to have robust governance arrangements, including a clear organisational structure with well-defined, transparent and consistent lines of responsibility.",
            "9. Article 28 of Directive (EU) 2019/2034 sets out requirements for the involvement of the management body in risk management and the setting up of a risk committee for investment firms.",
            "10. In accordance with Article 25 of Directive (EU) 2019/2034 and Article 7 of Regulation (EU) 2019/2033, these guidelines apply on an individual and consolidated basis. For this purpose, parent undertakings and subsidiaries subject to Directive (EU) 2019/2034 must ensure that internal governance arrangements, processes and mechanisms in their subsidiaries are consistent and well integrated and that the governance arrangements on a consolidated basis are robust. In particular, it should be ensured that parent undertakings and subsidiaries subject to this Directive implement such arrangements, processes and mechanisms in their subsidiaries that are not subject to this Directive, including those established in third countries - including offshore financial centres.",
            "11. The guidelines should be read, taking into account and without prejudice to Articles 9, 16, 23 and 24 of Directive (EU) 2014/65, the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/5652 and the Commission Delegated Directive (EU) No 2017/5933, in conjunction with the EBA guidelines on sound remuneration policies for investment firms, the joint EBA and ESMA guidelines on the assessment of the suitability of members of the management body and key function holders, the EBA guidelines on the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP), the ESMA guidelines on certain aspects of the MiFID II compliance function requirements, the ESMA guidelines on product governance and the Regulatory Technical Standards on disclosures.

            "13. Combating money laundering and terrorist financing is essential for maintaining the stability and integrity of the financial system. Uncovering the involvement of an investment firm in money laundering and terrorist financing might have an impact on its viability and on trust in the financial system. Together with the authorities and bodies (e.g. AML supervisors and financial intelligence units) responsible for ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering rules under Directive (EU) 2015/849, competent authorities have an important role to play in identifying and tackling weaknesses in this area. In this context, the guidelines clarify that identifying, managing and mitigating money laundering and financing of terrorism risks is part of sound internal governance arrangements and investment firms' risk management framework.",
            "14. In the same way, investment firms should take into account environmental, social and governance (ESG) risk factors within their risk management framework.",
            "15. The guidelines are intended to apply to all existing board structures without interfering with the general allocation of competences in accordance with national company law or advocating any particular structure. Accordingly, they should be applied irrespective of the board structure used (unitary or dual board structure or another structure) and across Member States. The management body, as defined in points (23) and (24) of Article 3(1) of Directive (EU) 2019/2034, should be understood as having management (executive) and supervisory (non-executive) functions.",
            "16. The terms 'management body in its management function' and 'management body in its supervisory function' are used throughout these guidelines without referring to any specific governance structure, and references to the management (executive) or supervisory (non- executive) function should be understood as applying to the bodies or members of the management body responsible for that function in accordance with national law.",
            "17. In Member States where the management body delegates, partially or fully, the executive function to a person or an internal executive body (e.g. a chief executive officer (CEO), management team or executive committee), the persons who perform these executive functions and direct the business of the institution on the basis of that delegation should be understood as constituting the management function of the management body. For the purposes of these guidelines, any reference to the management body in its management function should be understood as also including the members of the executive body or the CEO, as defined in these guidelines, even if they have not been proposed or appointed as formal members of an investment firm's governing body or bodies under national law. 6 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE UNDER DIRECTVIE (EU) 2019/2034 EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY",
            "18. The management body is empowered to set the investment firm's strategy, objectives and overall direction, and oversees and monitors management decision-making. In its management function, the management body directs the investment firm. Senior management is accountable to the management body for the day-to-day running of the investment firm. In its supervisory function, the management body oversees and challenges the management function and provides appropriate advice. The oversight roles include reviewing the performance of the management function and the achievement of objectives, challenging the strategy, and monitoring and scrutinising the systems that ensure the integrity of financial information as well as the soundness and effectiveness of risk management and internal controls.",
            "19. Taking into consideration all the existing governance structures provided for by national laws, competent authorities should ensure the effective and consistent application of the guidelines in their jurisdictions in accordance with the rationale and objectives of the guidelines themselves. For this purpose, competent authorities may clarify the governing bodies and functions to which the tasks and responsibilities set forth in the guidelines pertain, where this is appropriate to ensure the proper application of the guidelines in accordance with the governance structures provided for under national company law.",
            "20. Having independent directors within the supervisory function of the management body helps to ensure that the interests of all internal and external stakeholders are considered and that independent judgement is exercised where there is an actual or potential conflict of interest4.",
            "21. With regard to the composition of committees and in particular with regard to independent members, the guidelines take into account the principle of proportionality. Simpler provisions have therefore been introduced for smaller investment firms.",
            "22. While not subject to the governance requirements in accordance with Article 25 of Directive (EU) 2019/2034, small and non - interconnected investment firms should have robust strategies, policies, processes and systems in place for the identification, measurement, management and monitoring of material sources and effects of risk to clients and any material impact on own funds, material sources and effects of risk to market and any material impact on own funds and liquidity risk over an appropriate set of time horizons, including intra-day, so as to ensure that the investment firm maintains adequate levels of liquid resources in accordance with Article 29(3) of Directive (EU) 2019/2034.",
            "23. The guidelines are consistent with the 'three lines of defence' model in identifying the functions within investment firms responsible for addressing and managing risks. Investment firms should establish and maintain a permanent and effective compliance function that operates independently from the business it controls and, where appropriate and taking into account the application of the proportionality principle, establish and maintain risk management and internal audit functions that operate independently. Where those functions 4 In this regard, the guidelines are based on the Commission Recommendation of 15 February 2005 on the role of non- executive or supervisory directors of listed companies and on the committees of the (supervisory) board. 7 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE UNDER DIRECTVIE (EU) 2019/2034 EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY are not established, investment firms should ensure that the policies and procedures that they have adopted and implemented regarding risk management and internal audit achieve the same objectives.",
            "24. The business lines, as part of the first line of defence, take risks and are directly and permanently responsible for their operational management. For that purpose, business lines should have appropriate processes and controls in place that aim to ensure risks are identified, analysed, measured, monitored, managed, reported and kept within the limits of the investment firms' risk appetite, and that the business activities are in compliance with external and internal requirements.",
            "25. Not only business lines, but also other functions or units, e.g. HR, legal or information technology, are responsible for managing their risks and having appropriate controls in place. Other functions or units are mainly exposed to operational and reputational risks that must be considered by the compliance function and risk management function when forming an enterprise-wide holistic view of all risks. All other functions or units should also be subject to monitoring and oversight by the independent risk management function, where established, and by the compliance function as part of a risk-based approach.",
            "26. The independent risk management function, where established, and the compliance function form the second line of defence. The risk management function facilitates the implementation of a sound risk management framework throughout the investment firm and is responsible for further identifying, monitoring, analysing, measuring, managing and reporting risks and forming a holistic view of all risks on an individual and, where applicable, consolidated basis. It challenges and assists in the implementation of risk management measures by the business lines in order to ensure that the processes and controls in place in the first line of defence are properly designed and effective. The compliance function monitors compliance with legal requirements and internal policies, provides advice on compliance issues to the management body and other relevant staff, and establishes policies and processes to manage compliance risks and to ensure compliance5. The compliance function and, where established, the risk management function intervene as necessary to ensure the modification of internal control and risk management systems within the first line of defence.",
            "27. The internal audit function, where established as an independent third line of defence, conducts risk-based and general audits and reviews the internal governance arrangements, processes and mechanisms to ascertain that they are sound and effective, implemented and consistently applied. The internal audit function is also in charge of the independent review of the first two lines of defence including other internal functions, units and business lines. Investment firms that do not establish an independent audit function must establish other appropriate audit policies and procedures. In any case, the ultimate responsibility for audits remains with the management body.",

The requirements on governance arrangements under the IFD are very similar to the requirements under the CRD and apply to investment firms, unless they meet all of the conditions to qualify as small and non-interconnected investment firms under Article 12(1) of Regulation (EU) 2019/2033 (IFR) or are subject to the CRD requirements in accordance with Article 2(2) IFD.",
            "30. The CRD and IFD are both based on the same governance concepts and principles of good governance arrangements, while taking into account that investment firms are often smaller or less complex. Therefore a more proportionate approach is taken for such investment firms, in particular regarding the establishment of committees and control functions. Most investment firms that are now subject to the governance provisions under the IFD have been subject to the requirements under the CRD, and consistency should therefore be ensured to the extent possible to reduce the implementation costs for such firms and to ensure that consistent group-wide policies can be applied.",
            "31. The guidelines and the principle of proportionality cannot change the minimum requirements included in the IFD. The same holds true with regard to the requirements under MiFID that apply to all investment firms. All provisions within the guidelines are subject to the principle of proportionality, meaning that they are to be applied in a manner that is appropriate, taking into account in particular the investment firm's size, internal organisation and nature, and the complexity of its activities. However, the principle of proportionality does not mean that investment firms are permitted to not meet certain requirements, i.e. requirements cannot be waived unless the IFD explicitly allows for such waivers when the underlying conditions are met.",
            "32. The guidelines also specify the requirements under Article 26 of Directive (EU) 2019/2034, in particular with regard to the setting up of new structures e.g. in third countries, including also in offshore financial centres. These requirements aim to increase the transparency of and reduce the risks connected with such activities. Guidelines are also provided regarding investment firms' reporting on governance arrangements, including in relation to such structures.",
            "33. The guidelines aim to establish a sound risk culture in investment firms. Risks should be taken within a well-defined framework in line with the investment firms' risk strategy and risk appetite. This includes the establishment of and ensuring compliance with a system of limits and controls. Risks within new products6 and business areas, but also risks that may result from changes to investment firms' products, processes and systems, are to be duly identified, assessed, appropriately managed and monitored.

            "35. In order to manage conflicts of interest, the management body should ensure that a framework for the identification and, where necessary, mitigation of conflicts of interest is in place. The investment firm, its organisational substructures, staff and shareholders hold different interests that should be considered in such a framework in order to ensure that decisions are taken objectively without the undue influence of conflicts of interest. Examples of typical sources of conflicts of interest are diverging economic interests of different parties involved, or close links between decision-makers and contractual parties.",
            "36. The management body has the highest decision-making powers. Consequently, the identification and management of conflicts of interest of members of the management body and parties closely related to the members of the management body is a cornerstone of sound internal governance practices. Therefore, the guidelines also specify the measures that should be implemented by investment firms to prudently manage conflicts of interests that may arise from entering into transactions, including with members of the management body and their related parties. Those transactions may include loans where there is the possibility for investment firms to grant loans as ancillary services. 10 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE UNDER DIRECTIVE (EU) 2019/2034 EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY EBA/GL/2021/14 22 November 2021 Guidelines on internal governance under Directive (EU) 2019/2034 11 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE UNDER DIRECTIVE (EU) 2019/2034 EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY",

The risk management framework should enable the investment firm to make fully informed decisions on risk-taking. The risk management framework should encompass all risks as well as actual risks and future risks that the investment firm may be exposed to. Risks should be evaluated from the bottom up and from the top down, within and across business lines, using consistent terminology and compatible methodologies throughout the investment firm and at a consolidated level. All relevant risks should be encompassed in the risk management framework with appropriate consideration given to both financial and non-financial risks, including market, liquidity, concentration, operational, IT, reputational, legal, conduct, compliance with AML/CTF and other financial crime, ESG and strategic risks. 44 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE UNDER DIRECTIVE (EU) 2019/2034 EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY",

This guidance should, where appropriate, establish and maintain internal limits consistent with the investment firm's risk appetite and commensurate with its sound operation, financial strength, capital base and strategic goals. An investment firm's risk profile should be kept within these established limits.

The tools should include the assessment of the actual risk profile against the investment firm's risk appetite, as well as the identification and assessment of potential and stressed risk exposures under a range of assumed adverse circumstances against the investment firm's risk capacity. The tools should provide information on any adjustment to the risk profile that may be required. Investment firms should make appropriately conservative assumptions when building stressed scenarios.",

Investment firms should take into consideration that the results of quantitative assessment methodologies, including stress testing, are highly dependent on the limitations and assumptions of the models (including the severity and duration of the shock and the underlying risks). For example, models showing very high returns on economic capital may result from a weakness in the models (e.g. the exclusion of some relevant risks) rather than a superior strategy or excellent execution of a strategy on the part of the investment firm. The determination of the level of risk taken should not therefore be based only on quantitative information or model outputs; it should also comprise a qualitative approach (including expert judgement and critical analysis). Relevant macroeconomic environmental trends and data should be explicitly addressed to identify their potential impact on exposures and portfolios.",

Regular and transparent reporting mechanisms should be established so that the management body, its risk committee, where established, and all relevant units in an investment firm are provided with reports in a timely, accurate, concise, understandable and meaningful manner and can share relevant information about the identification, measurement or assessment, monitoring and management of risks. The reporting framework should be well defined and documented.",

            "1. Executive summary These guidelines (GL) specify how loss given default (LGD) appropriate for an economic downturn, which has been identified in accordance with the final draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on economic downturn, should be quantified. They supplement the Guidelines on PD estimation, LGD estimation and the treatment of defaulted assets (EBA/GL/2017/16)1 of 20/11/2017 (GL on PD and LGD estimation) and provide specific guidance on how to estimate LGD appropriate for an economic downturn. These GL are hence an addendum to the GL on PD and LGD estimation, which are part of the European Banking Authority's (EBA's) roadmap to reduce unwarranted variability of risk parameters and own funds requirements. As such, this publication completes the plan outlined in the report on the review of the Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) approach published in February 2016.2,3 The policy for downturn LGD estimation builds on the notion of an economic downturn that is specified in the final draft regulatory technical standards on the specification of the nature, severity and duration of an economic downturn in accordance with Articles 181(3)(a) and 182(4)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR), published on 16 November 2018.4 The RTS on economic downturn set out the requirements for the identification of an economic downturn for the type of exposures covered by a rating system. As a rating system may, however, cover exposures from different businesses, sectors and geographical areas, the notion of an economic downturn set forth in the RTS may comprise several distinct downturn periods. The GL for downturn LGD estimation provide guidance on how to calibrate downturn LGD appropriate for an economic downturn, taking into account the downturn period(s) identified in accordance with the RTS. To this end, the GL differentiate three types of approaches for calibrating downturn LGD: (i) type 1 approaches, based on the observed impact on losses of a particular downturn period; (ii) type 2 approaches, where such an impact on losses has not been observed (e.g. because the downturn periods identified in accordance with the RTS have occurred too long ago) but the impact can be estimated using a limited set of methodologies;"

            "4. Because of this understanding, the level at which downturn LGDs are calibrated should be at least the same as the level at which long-run average LGDs are calculated for the purpose of calibration. In this context, it should be recalled that the GL on PD and LGD estimation define the notion of 'calibration segments' as a uniquely identified subset of the range of application of the LGD model that is jointly calibrated. The use of calibration segments does not, however, require institutions to calibrate LGDs at the level of calibration segments. Institutions may use calibration segments but calibrate LGD estimates at the level of each grade or pool (e.g. if, in the step of calibration, the portfolio under consideration is split by certain regions) within those calibration segments. However, regardless of whether an institution calculates the long- run average LGD at the level of calibration segments or at the level of grades or pools, both with the objective of providing LGD estimates by facility grade or pool, the quantification of downturn LGD estimates should follow the level considered by the institution for the purpose of calibrating LGD estimates to the long-run average LGD.",
            "5. In line with the aspects covered by the CRR in the context of quantification of risk parameters, these GL provide, in addition, requirements on MoC related to downturn LGD estimation. Issues of representativeness have not been addressed, as these are covered by subsection 4.2.4 of the GL on PD and LGD estimation.

This sub-section in the CRR covers aspects including representativeness, MoC and parameter estimations per grade or pool that lead to the quantification of the final parameters being applied in calculating RWE amounts. The CRR refers to parameter estimation where rules for quantification of PD and LGD estimates are set out (e.g. Article 180 of the CRR).",
            "7. The term 'calibration target' is not used in the CRR. However, where it is used in this section it refers to the value that is considered for the purpose of calibration in accordance with paragraph 161 of the GL on PD and LGD estimation. It should be noted that the specification of a calibration target in this sense and the estimation might coincide where institutions use LGD models (in the sense of Article 174 of the CRR) that assign exposures to facility grades or pools without providing for individual estimates of loss. In this case, the LGD model just 7 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY provides a grading or pooling of facilities, and the calibration target (e.g. long-run average LGD per facility grade and pool) coincides with the estimation of LGD per facility grade and pool. As stated earlier, the quantification of LGD or downturn LGD covers, in addition, the application of an appropriate MoC.",
            "8. In this context, it should be noted that the GL on PD and LGD estimation define the estimation of risk parameters as including risk differentiation and risk quantification, and that in this sense these GL on downturn LGD treat only the risk quantification part of downturn LGD estimation. The GL on PD and LGD envisage this interpretation of downturn LGD estimate by defining LGD calibration as: The part of the process of the estimation of risk parameters which leads to appropriate risk quantification by ensuring that the LGD estimates correspond to the long-run average LGD, or to the downturn LGD estimate where this is more conservative, at the level relevant for the applied method.7 Risk differentiation CRR Articles 170 - 174 Internal rating grade Facility grade 1 Facility grade 2 Facility grade 3 Calibration Facility grade 4 Facility grade 5 Facility grade 6 Facility grade 7 Facility grade 8 Facility grade 9 Risk quantification CRR Articles 178 - 184 Internal rating grade LGD DT LGD Facility grade 1 5% 7% Facility grade 2 8% 10% Facility grade 3 15%",

Therefore, all definitions and all relevant requirements of section 4 on general estimation requirements, section 6 on LGD estimation, section 7 on LGD- in-default estimation, section 8 on the application of risk parameters and section 9 on the review of estimates of the GL on PD and LGD estimation equally apply to downturn LGD estimation.",
            "15. This means in particular that the concept of the MoC laid down in the GL on PD and LGD estimation should also be applied to downturn LGD estimation. Therefore, the MoC for downturn LGD estimation should be assessed in accordance with the requirements set out in subsection 4.4 of the GL on PD and LGD estimation. In particular, this means that institutions should: a. . identify all deficiencies related to the estimation of downturn LGDs that may lead to a bias in the quantification of the estimates or to an increased uncertainty which is not captured by the general estimation error specifically related to the downturn LGD estimation in accordance with the guidance set out in subsection 4.4.1 of the GL on PD and LGD estimation; b. apply appropriate adjustments (as described in subsection 4.4.2 of the GL on PD and LGD estimation) to overcome the identified deficiencies in order to provide a more accurate downturn LGD estimation; and 11 EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN c. reflect the uncertainty of the downturn LGD estimation (including appropriate adjustments) by quantifying an MoC subdivided into three categories: i. Category A: MoC related to data and methodological deficiencies identified under Category A as referred to in paragraph 36(a) of the GL on PD and LGD estimation; ii. Category B: MoC related to relevant changes to underwriting standards, risk appetite, collection and recovery policies and any other source of additional uncertainty identified under Category B as referred to in paragraph 36(b) of the GL on PD and LGD estimation; and iii. Category C: MoC related to the general estimation error.",
            "16. The GL clarify in paragraph 14(a) that downturn LGD should be calibrated at least at the same level as that at which the long-run average LGD is calculated for the purpose of calibrating LGD in accordance with paragraph 161 of the GL on PD and LGD estimation. The rationale for this is that downturn LGD estimation should be understood as risk quantification of LGD estimates appropriate for an economic downturn, i.e. that the downturn LGD calibration just provides a different calibration target from long-run average LGD and sets out additional requirements regarding the applicable MoC. Thus, if an institution considers the long-run average LGDs by grades or pools (in line with paragraph 161(a) of the GL on PD and LGD estimation) with the objective of calibrating LGD estimates for these grades or pools, it needs to consider the same level for quantifying downturn LGD. If an institution considers long-run average LGDs calculated at the level of calibration segments for the purpose of LGD calibration (in line with Article 161(b) of the GL on PD and LGD estimation), it needs to quantify downturn LGDs for the purpose of downturn LGD calibration at least by calibration segment.",
            "17.In addition paragraph 14(b) provides guidance on the use of calibration segments in downturn LGD estimation analogous to paragraph 97 of the GL on PD and LGD estimation, which provides guidance on the use of calibration segments for PD estimation. An institution should identify subsets of the type of exposure under consideration as calibration segments, where exposures in these subsets are covered by the same LGD model for assignment to facility grades but on average show significantly different loss profiles, and where exposures in these subsets are affected differently by downturn periods. At a minimum, banks are required to consider material subsets of exposures covering different geographical areas/jurisdictions or industry sectors or, in the case of retail, product types as calibration segments. The rationale for this minimum requirement is that economic factors in the RTS are required to be customised to each relevant jurisdiction and sector. A typical example of where the use of calibration segments should be considered is the situation when an LGD model is rolled out to a different jurisdiction. The drivers for LGD might be the same in a different jurisdiction and thus the LGD model might provide a reasonable risk differentiation in a different jurisdiction, but the overall loss profile might be significantly different due to, for example, different legal processes in the context of collateral liquidation. It may, however, also turn out that loss characteristics and levels are independent from, for example, jurisdictions or industry sectors, in which case the differentiation of calibration segments might not be necessary. 12 EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN",
            "18.The provision set out in paragraph 15 of the GL ensures that, as a general concept, an institution needs to estimate downturn LGDs appropriate to each downturn period identified in accordance with the RTS on economic downturn. As the approach in the RTS can lead to the identification of multiple downturn periods, institutions need to calibrate downturn LGD and provide the resulting LGD downturn estimates in relation to different downturn periods. Consequently, this may require institutions to calibrate downturn LGD based on different types of approaches (as described in section 2.5 of this Background and rationale), as loss data might be available for some identified downturn periods, but not for others.",
            "19.Given that, in the case of multiple downturn periods, institutions may have to use different approaches in order to set the calibration target, it is important to specify in detail how this interaction should work, which will in turn specify which final downturn LGD estimates should be selected. Therefore, three principles are laid down in the policy: i. First, the proposed policy requires that the final downturn LGD estimates relate to one downturn period per calibration segment. ii. Second, where for one of the downturn periods identified downturn LGD is calibrated using a type 3 approach and for another downturn period downturn LGD is calibrated using a type 1 or type 2 approach, then the latter shall be taken into account for the final LGD downturn estimates and an MoC needs to be added for the lack of analysis of one downturn period. In brief, downturn LGD estimation subject to the minimum add-on is disregarded where downturn LGD estimation is possible based on observed or estimated impact for any other downturn period subject to an additional appropriate MoC. Under no circumstances should this principle be abused to circumvent the obligatory use of type 2 approaches where their application is possible. Indeed, it is expected that type 3 approaches will be considered only in exceptional cases. Therefore, the waiver for downturn periods that require a type 3 approach as set out in paragraph 15(a)(iv) of the GL will be revised by the EBA, should there be indications of excessive or misuse of this waiver. iii. Third, where LGD estimates are quantified for several downturn periods, institutions should choose as the finally relevant downturn period the period that results in the highest average downturn LGD for the calibration segment under consideration. It is important to note that this refers to the average downturn LGD of the latest available snapshot of the current non-defaulted portfolio at the time of calibration.",
            "20.The rationale for the first principle is that, where different calibration segments cover exposures from, for example, different jurisdictions, industry sectors or even product types for retail exposures, the multiple downturn periods will have different impacts on these calibration segments. The second principle is justified by the fact that the LGD estimates based on type 3 approaches are not based on observed or estimated impact on loss data and are therefore considered less reliable. The third principle ensures that the estimation is based on the downturn period that leads to the highest expected impact when applying the final downturn LGD estimation. In this context, it should be noted that theoretically an institution might have to apply a type 3 approach for several downturn periods and might not be able to 13 EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN quantify downturn LGD for any downturn periods based on a type 1 or type 2 approach. In this case, the second principle would not be applicable and the third principle would provide guidance for the choice of the finally relevant downturn period.",
            "21.It is important to note that the downturn LGD estimates for the grades and pools of one calibration segment refer to the same downturn period, although the actual downturn LGD estimates per grade and pool will be different. Example 1 As an example, consider an obligor-based retail rating system covering three types of facilities: mortgages, consumer credits and overdrafts on current accounts. For the purpose of long-run average LGD calculation, the system differentiates between two calibration segments: (A) mortgages; and (B) consumer credits and overdrafts on current accounts. In accordance with Article 1(2) of the final draft RTS on economic downturn, the economic downturn should be identified for each type of exposure, where the latter should be understood in the sense of Article 142(2) of the CRR (i.e. as exposures that are homogeneously managed). Therefore, in this example (where it is assumed that all three products are homogeneously managed), for both calibration segments the institution should analyse the impact of downturn periods identified in accordance with the RTS by considering the following economic factors: i. GDP growth and unemployment rate, which are relevant economic factors for all exposure categories, according to Article 2(1)(a) of the final draft RTS on economic downturn; ii. house price index, which according to Article 2(1)(b)(i) of the final draft RTS on economic downturn is relevant to the exposure category 'corporate and retail residential real estate'; iii. household debt1, which according to Article 2(b)(i) of the RTS on economic downturn is relevant to the exposure category 'retail other than i., ii. or iii'. The final downturn LGD estimates for the calibration segment under consideration refer to the single downturn period leading to the highest downturn LGD estimates (on average), as set out in paragraph 15 of the GL text. 14 EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN Example 1 - cont. Furthermore, assume that GDP growth, unemployment rate and total household debt define one common downturn period lasting from 2008 to 2010 and the housing price index defines a second downturn period lasting from 1990 to 1991 (all identified in accordance with the final draft RTS on economic downturn). In this case, the institution would need to provide the following downturn LGD estimates: Example Calibration Segment A: Mortgages Calibration Segment B: Consumer credits and overdrafts Downturn Period 1 (DTP_1) 1990 - 1991 Trough on house price index LGD downturn estimation related to downturn period 1: LGD_DT(A, DTP_1) (incl. MoC) LGD downturn estimation related to downturn period 1: LGD_DT(B, DTP_1) (incl. MoC) Downturn Period 2 (DTP_2) 2008 - 2010 Trough in GDP Growth and peak in unemployment rate and total household debt LGD downturn estimation related to downturn period 2: LGD_DT(A, DTP_2) (incl. MoC) LGD downturn estimation related to downturn period 2: LGD_DT(B, DTP_2) (incl. MoC) Moreover, this implies, for the example above, that the institution should estimate two downturn LGDs for the calibration segment (A) mortgages, one relating to downturn period 1 (1990-1991, specified based on the house price index) and another related to downturn period 2 (2008-2010, defined on the basis of GDP growth, unemployment rate and total household debt), and pick as the relevant downturn period the period that results in the higher of the two downturn LGD estimates, considered as averages at calibration segment level. This comparison is necessary because, otherwise, different grades could refer to different downturn periods, which would result in undue complexity and would lack economic rationale. If the institution does not have, or is not able to estimate, an impact on loss data for the downturn period 1990-1991 and, therefore, the downturn LGD is subject to the minimum MoC requirement as set out in section 7, the latter will not be used when comparing it with the downturn LGD estimated for the downturn period 2008-2010 even if higher (unless the LGD for 2008-2010 is also estimated in accordance with methodologies described in section 7). However, an appropriate MoC should be added to the final downturn LGD estimate to cover the downturn period not analysed. Conversely, if the institution does not have data to estimate downturn LGDs based on observed impact related to the downturn period 1990-1991, but it is able to estimate downturn LGDs based on the estimated impact and in accordance with the methodologies described in section 6, then this estimation might be compared with the downturn LGD estimated for the downturn period 2008-2010. In this example, this is justified because it could be expected that the impact from the drop in the house price index observed in 1990-1991 characterises the more relevant downturn period for calibration segment A.",
            "22.Paragraph 15(b) of the GL lays down that, where institutions can provide evidence that a downturn period is not relevant to one of the calibration segments, that downturn period can 15 EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN be disregarded for that calibration segment. For this purpose, institutions should provide evidence that the economic factors underlying the downturn period under consideration are not relevant to the calibration segment under consideration. This will be the case mainly when downturn periods are defined based on sectoral or industry-specific factors and the calibration segments are also defined in terms of sectors or industry segments. In these cases, the downturn period defined based on economic indicators related to industry A will not be relevant to the calibration segment related to industry B. However, if the downturn period is defined based on economic indicators related to both industries A and B, this will also be relevant to the calibration segment related to industry B. Thus, in Example 1 above, the downturn period 1990-1991 may be disregarded for calibration segment B, consisting of consumer credits and overdrafts, when properly justified."

            "24. The policy proposed in paragraph 16 of the GL provides guidance related to the first sentence of Article 181(1)(b) of the CRR, which requires that institutions use LGD estimates that are appropriate for an economic downturn if those are more conservative than the long-run average LGD (LRA). The GL clarify how this requirement should be interpreted in the context of calibration of downturn LGD. It should be noted, however, that this requirement to compare downturn and long-run average LGD used for calibration is without prejudice to the requirement in Article 181(1)(b) of the CRR to ensure that the actual downturn LGD estimates are used (in application) if they are more conservative than long-run average LGDs. In general, and technically speaking, downturn LGD may be calibrated in either of the following ways: a) directly, independently of the long-run average LGD estimation or b) by an adjustment to the long-run average LGD.",
            "25.For the purpose of providing guidance on the CRR article in question, it seemed helpful to differentiate the two different technical approaches. In order to comply with the requirement that the higher of the long-run average and the downturn LGD estimate constitutes the final LGD estimate, paragraph 16 requires that the long-run average LGD plus the corresponding MoC be compared with the corresponding downturn LGD plus the corresponding MoC at the level relevant to the calibration. Although paragraph 14 allows downturn LGDs to be calibrated on a more granular level than the long-run average LGD, it is expected that generally the level of calibration for long-run average LGD and downturn LGD will be the same. In exceptional cases, however, where banks use a more granular level for the calibration of downturn LGD, institutions need to provide a meaningful aggregation in order to compare the downturn and long-run average LGDs used for calibration. 16 GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY However, where a downturn adjustment is applied to the long-run average LGD, this requirement implies that the MoC applied to the final LGD estimate (i.e. LRA + downturn adjustment + MoC) needs to account for both (i) the uncertainty related to the estimation of long-run average LGD and (ii) the uncertainty related to the calculation of the downturn adjustment. Example 2 If the downturn LGD is calibrated at grade level and the long-run average LGD is calculated at calibration segment level for the purpose of calibration, here is one example of how this comparison could be done in practice. The institution could calculate the resulting downturn LGD estimates plus their corresponding MoCs for all facilities in the reference data set (specific to the calibration segment under consideration and on which the long-run average LGD is calculated) and compare the resulting (case-weighted) average downturn LGD with the long-run average LGD used for calibration.",
            "26.Paragraph 17 of the GL relates to the second sentence of Article 181(1)(b) of the CRR, which requires that institutions make adjustments to their estimates of risk parameters by grade or pool to limit the capital impact of an economic downturn if a rating system is expected to deliver realised LGDs at a constant level by grade or pool over time. The EBA considers that this provision is meant to ensure that the capital impact that stems from the migrations between facility grades and pools (e.g. in cases where risk drivers sensitive to the economic cycle are used) does not lead over time to an over- or underestimation of the LGDs appropriate for an economic downturn. This provision, however, targets migrations caused by changes in the economic cycle. Structural changes over time in a portfolio under consideration (which might also be caused by changes in economic conditions, e.g. due to tightened underwriting standards) are a matter of representativeness and should be treated in accordance with section 4 of the GL on PD and LGD. This entails in particular that institutions should assume that no exposures would have been newly added to a calibration segment and that no exposures would have left a calibration segment due to orderly termination of the contract, when considering the likely distribution of the current portfolio affected by the relevant downturn period. 17 EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN Example 3 As an example, a simplified LGD model for a retail mortgage portfolio with just one risk driver, in this case the loan-to-value ratio (LTV), could be considered. Thus, the LTV buckets define the pools of the LGD model under consideration. It is assumed that this LTV is defined as an updated LTV, i.e. an LTV metric where house price index (HPI) variations affect the value of the collateral and hence the denominator of the LTV metric. Thus, this risk driver is sensitive to the economic cycle (as defined by the economic factor HPI). In order to illustrate the impact of migrations caused by the economic cycle via such a risk driver on the distribution of facilities over grades and thus the final downturn LGD estimation, it is assumed that the composition of the portfolio remains constant1. In this case, when moving into an upturn, house prices might increase (HPI increase) and, since the LTV is affected by such increases, facilities tend to migrate to better LTV grades (i.e. LTVs tend to decrease). In the illustration below, the yellow band represents LTVs of 100% or higher, the grey band represents LTVs between 80% and 100%, the red band represents LTVs between 40% and 80%, and the blue band represents LTVs between 0% and 40%: DOWNTURN HPI INCREASE UPTURN 100% 90% 15% 28% 80% 70% 60% 50% 50% 40% 55% 30% 20% 30% 10% 15% 0% 5% 2% DT UP [100, +) = [80, 100) [40,80) [0,40) In this example, it is also assumed that the downturn LGD estimates for the LTV buckets are quantified using the methodologies described in section 5, i.e. based on the impact on loss data available for the downturn period under consideration.

            "27.In summary, Example 3 illustrates that, in cases of LGD models based on risk drivers sensitive to the economic cycle, the impact on the current capital requirements of an upcoming economic upturn (or downturn) is twofold: (i) the impact stemming from the expected lower (or higher) realised economic losses per facility (in the event of a downturn, this is covered by the downturn LGD estimation by grade) and (ii) the impact stemming from the migrations of facilities to lower (or higher) LTV bands.",
            "28.It is indeed true that the loss rates in the higher LTV bands already reflect the expected realised LGDs under upcoming downturn conditions. The expected realised loss (in contrast to the loss rates) will, however, be higher, due to the higher proportion of facilities that migrate to the higher LTV bands.",
            "29. The provision in paragraph 17 serves the purpose of ensuring that those LGD models that are based on risk drivers sensitive to the economic cycle appropriately estimate the economic loss (appropriate for an economic downturn) in the current state of the economic cycle at the time of calibration. The provision thus contains an expectation that for those LGD models an adjustment to the downturn LGDs should be applied that is higher in a favourable economic state of the economic cycle (at the time of calibration or recalibration) and smaller in an adverse state of the economic cycle (at the time of calibration or recalibration). If, however, the institution applies a downturn estimation methodology that incorporates this expectation (e.g. where the risk drivers are adjusted to reflect downturn conditions), then there is no need for additional adjustments. Indeed, the application of paragraph 17 of the GL should in no case lead to a double incorporation of the impact of an economic downturn. In this context, institutions should take into account that the underlying LGD model has to provide for 19 EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN sufficient homogeneity of exposures assigned to the same grades or pools in accordance with Article 38 of the RTS on assessment methodology.",
            "30.In this context, it should be recalled that section 9 of the GL on PD and LGD also applies to downturn LGD estimation and that in the light of paragraph 17 it might be necessary in the review of downturn LGD estimates to consider the effects of recent changes in the economic conditions on the current portfolio and where necessary recalibrate the final downturn LGD estimates.",
            "31.Paragraph 18 sets out the requirement to compare the resulting downturn LGD at the level of calibration segments (on the reference data set, RDS) with a reference value, which should be calculated following the rules set out in section 8 of the GL. The reference value is a challenger value; in the event of a material difference between the reference value and the downturn LGD estimates, this should be justified based on the guidance laid down in paragraph 19.",
            "32.In fact, the reference value can be driven by other issues than the impact of an economic downturn period (e.g. low number of defaults, changes in the portfolio composition, fraud or operational risk cases, or even natural disasters such as an earthquake). Even if the reference value is driven by an economic downturn period, the reference value itself should not be considered an appropriate quantification of downturn LGD (as it may not comply with all the requirements laid down in these GL). Therefore, specifically if downturn LGD estimation is based on type 1 approaches, institutions may use the evidence gathered from the impact assessment set out in paragraph 27 of the GL for the justification of the material difference. On the other hand, the selected years of the reference value might also point to a previously unidentified downturn period.",
            "33.It is important to stress the non-binding character of the reference value. In fact, as stated before, the reference value will generally not comply with the rules set out in these GL and should therefore not be used as a calibration target for downturn LGD estimation. In addition, it should be noted that the result of the re-assessment required by paragraph 19 may (and will in many cases) be that the downturn LGD estimation is appropriate.",
            "34. The reference value is nevertheless considered to be a meaningful supervisory tool, which supports the supervisory assessment of the resulting downturn LGD estimates and can support institutions in understanding the dynamics of their realised LGDs over time."

As a precondition to apply the policy laid down in this section, the institution should have identified the finally relevant downturn period per calibration segment for the non- defaulted exposures. As a general rule, for defaulted exposures, institutions should apply the GL for downturn LGD estimation for each reference date, but only in relation to the downturn period identified as relevant to the respective non-defaulted exposures. This will ensure that both LGD in default and LGD for non-defaulted exposures are based on the very same downturn period. 20 EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN",
            "36.As an exception, institutions may, for the purpose of estimating downturn LGD for defaulted exposures for a specific reference date, build on the estimation of downturn LGD at the time of default, if the institution can convincingly explain that this is a conservative estimate of downturn LGD in default for the specific reference date. In this context, it should be noted that the GL text in paragraph 21(b) refers to the downturn component for defaulted exposures at the moment of default. This is relevant, as in the event of partial write-offs at the moment of default the loss related to these write-offs will be relevant to the downturn LGD for non- defaulted exposure, but might not be taken into account for downturn LGD for defaulted exposure at the moment of default where compliant with paragraph 179 of the GL on PD and LGD estimation.",
            "37. The rationale for the exemption is that the LGD in default converges by construction to 100% and therefore the additional amount that can be lost due to an economic downturn decreases over time.",
            "38.Moreover, it should be noted that the policy for downturn LGD estimation for defaulted exposures relies on paragraph 193 of the GL on PD and LGD estimation, where it is clarified that the final LGD for defaulted exposure appropriate for economic downturn conditions should also include an appropriate MoC and where necessary potential additional unexpected losses during the recovery period referred to in Article 181(1)(h) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013."

            "44.It is worth noting that the guidance laid down in these GL builds on the general presumption of the advanced IRB approach (i.e. where the institution uses own estimates of LGDs) where risk parameters are quantified based on observed data. Therefore, as a first step and in line with the hierarchy of approaches, an institution needs to assess whether for a type of exposure under consideration sufficient loss data are available to assess the impact of a considered downturn period identified in accordance with the RTS on economic downturn. If that is the case, the institution follows the guidance for downturn LGD estimation based on observed impact laid down in this section.",
            "45.In order to ensure that all relevant aspects of the economic loss calculated in accordance with subsection 6.3.1 of the GL on PD and LGD estimation are covered appropriately, the minimum components of such an impact assessment are prescribed in paragraph 27 of the GL. In detail, the proposed impact assessment requires institutions to analyse whether there is evidence of impact of the downturn period under consideration on the four following components, namely (i) elevated realised LGDs; (ii) decreased annual recoveries; (iii) decreased number of facilities returned to non-defaulted status in a predefined time horizon, which should be appropriate for the type of exposure and reflect the usual time to cure; and (iv) prolonged time in default.",
            "46. Regarding the first two components, the required analysis touches upon the issue on whether the impact of an economic downturn should be considered with respect to the date of default or with respect to the date of receiving the material share of the recovery cash flows. On the one hand, considering the realised LGDs with respect to the time in default is more consistent with the calculation of RWE amounts, where the expected loss is expressed as the product of PD and LGD, i.e. implying that it refers to the same reference point in time. On the other hand, considering the impact on annual recoveries per source of cash flow (regardless of the dates of default) might better reflect the economic loss appropriate for an economic downturn. Indeed, it could be the case that, although the date of default reflected downturn conditions, collateral may be sold for a higher price once economic conditions have recovered - effectively leading to collateral prices reflecting economic upturn rather than downturn conditions. Because of these considerations, the proposed impact assessment requires both types of analyses in paragraph 27(a), points (i) and (ii).",
            "47.Moreover, for the analysis in paragraph 27(a)(i) the data need to be split into two subsets. One set should contain all facilities which have reached their maximum time to recovery as defined in paragraph 156 of the GL on PD and LGD estimation or which have been closed before they reached this point in time. The other set should contain all incomplete recovery processes that have not reached their maximum time to recovery. In a second step, evidence of impact of the downturn period under consideration should be analysed separately for the set containing complete recovery processes and those that have reached their maximum time to recovery, and for the set containing incomplete recovery processes. For the latter set, the impact on the recovery pattern for each vintage of default should be analysed and may provide input for, in particular, the downturn LGD estimation for defaulted exposure. 24 EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN",
            "48. The analysis of the additional components set out in paragraph 27(a), points (iii) and (iv), namely the decreased number of facilities returned to non-defaulted status and the prolonged time in default respectively, ensures the inclusion of the potential impact of a considered downturn period which may not be measurable at the level of the average realised LGD or annual recoveries. Indeed, if, for example, an impact is measurable only with respect to a material increase of observed time in default, this analysis will ensure the incorporation of the downturn impact into the LGD estimation, for example by applying the increased time in default to the observations. The same principle applies to facilities returned to non-defaulted status.",
            "49.Paragraph 27(b) of the GL accounts for situations in which one or several of the outlined analyses cannot be meaningfully conducted due to insufficient coverage of loss data during one year of a multi-year downturn period. This should not be confused with a situation in which no data are available for the considered downturn period because of this period being too far back in time. However, in order to account for the issue of scarce data, the policy allows the merging of consecutive years of observations as long as it is deemed of benefit for the analysis.",
            "50.Finally, the last paragraph on the impact assessment requires that any lag between a downturn period and its potential impact on the relevant loss data has to be taken into account. Due to the individual situations regarding data availability as well as the specifics of a considered type of exposure, no guidance is set out regarding the length of the time lags that should be considered.",
            "51.The guidance regarding the calibration of downturn LGD for cases in which loss data are available to assess the impact of a considered downturn period on a considered calibration segment is laid down in section 5 of the final GL. Paragraph 28 clarifies that the resulting LGD estimation needs to be coherent with the outcome obtained from the impact analysis. In other words, the final downturn LGDs should appropriately account for the material impacts of a considered downturn period on (i) the realised LGDs; (ii) the annual recoveries; (ii) the facilities returned to non-defaulted status; and (iv) time in default. The policy leaves flexibility to institutions with respect to the detailed methodology applied for the purpose of calibration of downturn LGD based on results of the impact assessment. The rationale for this is that the EBA considers that there is no one-size-fits-all aggregation scheme for the results obtained from the analyses required in paragraph 27. Depending on the risk profile of the considered type of exposure it might be appropriate to choose the average LGD by vintage of defaults affected by the considered downturn period where this best reflects the results obtained from the impact assessment laid down in paragraph 27(a), points (i) to (iv). In another case, in particular where the average LGD would incorporate significant catch-up effects due to late recoveries when economic conditions improved (as outlined in paragraph 45 above), it might be more appropriate to base the downturn LGD estimation on the impact observed on annual recoveries per source of cash flow. The flexibility to select an appropriate methodology to calibrate downturn LGD includes the ability to use the 'haircut approach', outlined in section 6 in the GL, as a methodology under section 5 of the GL.",
            "52.In order to reflect the material aspects addressed in the impact assessment in paragraph 27(a), points (i) to (iv), institutions should aim to continue reflecting the credit risk profile of the 25 EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN considered type of exposure. For example, setting a downturn haircut (based on observed loss data) on only the best-quality collateral based on materiality, in order to reflect the results obtained from the impact assessment, may not be a compliant approach, as it could lead to incentives to use less good-quality collateral.",
            "53. The impact analysis is particularly important to ensure that the long-run average LGD may be deemed appropriate as a downturn LGD estimate only when no impact of a considered downturn period can be observed on the relevant loss data and realised LGDs. The detailed conditions under which the long-run average LGD including the corresponding MoC may be appropriate for the final downturn LGD appropriate for an economic downturn are laid down in paragraph 29. It should be noted that only if observed data are available for a considered downturn period may the long-run average LGD (under certain conditions) be considered an appropriate downturn LGD estimate. In particular, it is required that the MoC under consideration cover for all additional elements of uncertainty related to the identified downturn periods, including deficiencies identified under Category A in accordance with paragraph 37(a) of the GL on PD and LGD estimation, and under Category B in accordance with paragraph 37(b) of the GL on PD and LGD estimation."

However, institutions should estimate that impact by applying either a haircut or an extrapolation approach. Where institutions have observed data for only a certain intermediate parameter or risk driver reflecting the impact of the downturn period under consideration, institutions should estimate the realised historical LGDs (which they have not observed) affected by the downturn period under consideration by combining the observed impact on the intermediate parameter or risk driver with the estimated impact of other intermediate parameters resulting from a haircut and/or extrapolation approach. As stated above, both approaches can be used to estimate unobserved realised LGDs or intermediate parameters or risk drivers from the past.",
            "55.The haircut approach provides an estimate indirectly by adjusting (i.e. applying a haircut to) the input variables of the LGD model. Thus, a haircut approach relies on the functional relationship that is established in the model between realised losses and certain input parameters. In particular, in order to apply a haircut approach, this functional relationship needs to describe the dependency of the LGD estimate on several risk drivers, of which at least one is an economic factor. This might especially be the case when collateral values are used as risk drivers . The downturn LGD estimate is then computed by applying the LGD model where the above-mentioned economic factor (or even factors) is/are adjusted to reflect the level observed in the downturn period under consideration. The haircut approach may equally be applied to intermediate risk parameters or risk drivers. 26 EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY GL FOR THE ESTIMATION OF LGD APPROPRIATE FOR AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN",
            "56.The extrapolation approach is a methodology to enable the institution to estimate downturn LGDs based on estimated historical loss data (based on backward extrapolation). This approach estimates 'realised' historical LGDs, intermediate parameters or even risk drivers that serve as an input into the LGD estimation model under consideration, by extrapolating them backwards in time based on the statistical dependency between the realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers and the relevant economic factors. It is worth noting that this dependency needs to be established using the observed loss data.",
            "57. The main difference from the haircut approach is that the extrapolation approach derives the calibration target for downturn LGD based on the RDS and a statistical model for the dependency between realised LGDs (aggregated at different points in time) and economic factors, whereas the haircut approach derives the calibration target for downturn LGD by applying an existing LGD estimation model to the current exposures using input variables adjusted to reflect downturn conditions.",
            "58.Finally, it is worth noting that, when the haircut or extrapolation approach is applied, a strictly positive Category A Moc8 needs to be applied to reflect the related uncertainty with respect to the estimated impact. This is laid down in paragraph 35 of the GL. Haircut approach",
            "59.Paragraph 31 of these GL describes the haircut approach and sets out the conditions under which institutions should apply this approach. Under this approach, the impact of a considered downturn period on the realised LGDs, intermediate parameters or risk drivers of a considered type of exposure is estimated by applying the LGD model using adjusted input parameters. Therefore, a precondition for the applicability of this approach is that the LGD model takes one or several economic factors as direct or transformed input. Then, when the LGD model is applied, these economic factors are adjusted to reflect the values of the economic factors observed in economic downturn conditions instead of applying the current values of these economic factors).",

This hierarchy is outlined in paragraphs 23 to 25 of the GL. Where loss data affected by a downturn period are available, the institution needs to follow the policy set out in section 5 of the final GL. Otherwise, the institution needs to follow the policy set out in section 6 and only in very exceptional cases should downturn LGD estimates be calibrated in accordance with section 7. This approach should make downturn LGD estimation more transparent and comparable than in the past. At the same time, it is aimed at providing sufficient flexibility for the institutions. The policy will make it easier to distinguish risk-based variability in applied LGD parameters from variability stemming from other sources.",
            "72. The policy also accounts for situations in which the observed impact of an economic downturn on the relevant loss data is zero or near zero. In addition, it clarifies the terminology by distinguishing between the identified economic downturn for a type of exposure under consideration and its impact, i.e. by noting that, if the relevant loss data show no impact of an economic downturn, it does not necessarily mean that there is no economic downturn or that there will be no impact in the future. Although there might be cases in which the identified economic factors do not show a cyclical pattern, the RTS on economic downturn provide a clear definition that works independently of such patterns (which could also just reflect very long cycles). Moreover, it should be noted that the notion of the duration provided in Article 3 of the RTS on economic downturn is particularly relevant to applying the policy laid down in paragraph 27 of the final GL and the notion of severity is particularly relevant to applying the policy laid down in paragraph 31 of the GL.",

            "3. Business model analysis: Without undermining the responsibility of the institution's management body for organising and running its business, the supervisory business model analysis should be the assessment of the viability of the current business model and the sustainability of the strategic plans. This analysis should also assist in revealing key vulnerabilities the institution is facing that may not be revealed by other elements of the SREP, including vulnerabilities stemming from ML/TF and ESG risks. Such analysis does not aim to rank the institutions' various business models.",
            "4. Assessment of internal governance and institution-wide controls: As part of the overall governance assessment, competent authorities should determine whether the internal governance framework of an institution is adequate given its risk profile, size, nature and complexity, and whether the institution sufficiently adheres to the requirements and standards of good internal governance and risk controls arrangements, including aspects such as diversity, non-discrimination and sound code of conduct. As part of the risk management framework, competent authorities should review the institution's internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP) and internal liquidity adequacy assessment process (ILAAP). The assessment should focus on the soundness, effectiveness and comprehensiveness of these processes, as well as on the reliability of the institution's internal estimates to support the supervisory determination of capital and liquidity adequacy. Furthermore, competent authorities should also assess the adequacy of institution's stress testing programmes, including scenarios and assumptions, and outcomes.",
            "5. Assessment of risks to capital: The SREP Guidelines provide guidance for the assessment of the most common risks to capital, encompassing credit and counterparty risk, market risk, operational risk and interest rate risk from non-trading activities (IRRBB), further split into sub-risk categories. Competent authorities should focus their assessment on the material risks the institution is or might be exposed to, including any 10 GL ON COMMON PROCEDURES AND METHODOLOGIES FOR SREP AND SUPERVISORY STRESS TESTING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY additional institution-specific risks that are not described in detail in the guidelines. The assessment should be performed in terms of the risk exposure as well as the quality of management and controls employed to mitigate the impact of the risk.",
            "6. Assessment of the adequacy of institution's own funds: Since an institution may face risks that are not covered or not fully covered by the own funds requirements in accordance with the CRR or the capital buffers specified in the CRD, the SREP Guidelines include guidance on the determination of the quantity and composition of additional own funds requirements (P2R) determined to cover such risks, emphasising on their institution- specific nature. As a separate stack of own funds requirements, the SREP Guidelines also include guidance on the assessment of the risk of excessive leverage and on the determination of the quantity and composition of additional own funds required to cover that risk (P2R-LR). Such P2R and P2R-LR should be set in a legally binding way, and institutions should be expected to meet them at all times. The determination of P2R and P2R-LR should be duly justified to institutions. Aiming to enhance the supervisory dialogue, the SREP Guidelines include guidance on the minimum scope of information and justification of the results of the SREP to be provided to institutions. Separate justification is expected for the leverage ratio capital layer and the risk-based capital layer. Where the outcomes of the relevant stress tests suggest that an institution may not be able to meet the applicable own funds requirements under stress conditions, or is excessively sensitive to the assumed scenarios, competent authorities should take appropriate supervisory measures to ensure the institution is adequately capitalised, including the imposition of guidance on additional own funds, separately, to address the risk of excessive leverage and other risks (P2G-LR and P2G). The SREP Guidelines provide guidance clarifying the setting of the P2G and P2G-LR, encompassing both the use of the results of the stress tests, where the maximum anticipated stress test impact should be considered, and possible adjustments depending on institution-specific circumstances. As P2G and P2G-LR are positioned above the combined buffer requirements, a failure to meet such requirements does not trigger automatic restrictions on distribution provided for in Article 141 of the CRD. To increase convergence and level the playing field between institutions, the SREP Guidelines specify the quality of capital competent authorities should require institutions to hold to meet their guidance on additional own funds, CET1 capital for P2G coverage, and Tier 1 for P2G-LR coverage, respectively.",
            "7. Assessment of liquidity and funding risks: The SREP Guidelines provide guidance for the assessment of the risks to liquidity and funding the institution is or might be exposed to over various time horizons, as well for the related risk management controls. Competent authorities should focus their assessment on risks identified as material for the institution. 11 GL ON COMMON PROCEDURES AND METHODOLOGIES FOR SREP AND SUPERVISORY STRESS TESTING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY",
            "8. Assessment of the adequacy of the institution's liquidity and funding resources: Competent authorities should determine whether the liquidity resources held by the institution ensure an appropriate coverage of risks to liquidity and funding, where applicable, taking adequate supervisory measures. Among such measures, competent authorities may consider imposing specific liquidity requirements to address concerns related to the institution's liquidity and funding resources.",
            "9. Overall SREP assessment and application of supervisory measures: Having conducted the assessment of the above SREP elements, competent authorities should form a comprehensive overview of the risk profile and viability of the institution concluding with the overall SREP assessment. Competent authorities should also consider any necessary supervisory measures to address concerns. These Guidelines provide practical guidance on the application of the supervisory measures listed in Articles 104a and 105 of the CRD, including the application of institution-specific additional own funds and liquidity requirements, as well as other measures of a qualitative nature. Scoring framework To help facilitate communication with the competent authorities and colleges of supervisors, foster comparability and a level playing field across institutions as well as to adequately prioritise supervisory resources and measures in the assessment of SREP elements, competent authorities should score from a range of '1' (low risk) to '4' (high risk), to reflect the supervisory view for reach element-specific title of the guidelines. Scores should be assigned based on supervisory judgement, taking into account assessment considerations provided in the guidelines. These guidelines introduce two types of scores, the first one indicating the likelihood that the risks to capital, liquidity and funding will have a significant impact on the institution, while the second type indicates the magnitude of risks to the institution's viability to be applied to the four SREP elements and overall SREP score. These guidelines do not suggest any automatic link between the scores and the level of supervisory response, nor do they link additional own funds requirements to the scores. 12 GL ON COMMON PROCEDURES AND METHODOLOGIES FOR SREP AND SUPERVISORY STRESS TESTING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Figure 2. Overview of the scoring framework Overall SREP Score Internal governance and institution-wide control Score Viability score: BMA Score Capital adequacy Score Liquidity adequacy Score Scores for material risks to capital (e.g. credit, market, operational etc.) Scores for liquidity and funding risks Risk scores Link between SREP and other supervisory processes Competent authorities should reflect in the SREP assessment available information and outcomes from other supervisory activities, including on-site inspections, approvals of internal models, authorisation approvals, outcomes of supervisory stress testing, assessment of recovery and resolution plans, market conduct and consumer protection activities, AML/CFT activities, etc. Likewise, the findings from the SREP assessment should inform other supervisory processes. Such cross-utilisation of findings from various activities to inform each other allows for truly integrated analysis and supervision of institutions, enhancing overall supervisory overview of institutions, their viability and risks, as well as maximises synergies in various areas of assessments. These guidelines also identify the relevant building blocks required for an effective supervisory stress testing programme. They focus on different forms of supervisory stress testing and objectives, the respective use for SREP purposes, aspects related to the organisation, resources and communication, and possible methodologies. In particular, the supervisory stress testing section complements the assessment on capital adequacy by further clarifying and operationalising procedures for setting P2G and P2G-LR. Assessment of the risk of money laundering and terrorism financing These guidelines provide common guidance on how to factor in the anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism AML/CFT-related aspects into the SREP. Such common guidance is important in view of the fact that failure to address money laundering and terrorist financing risks by institutions can have detrimental effects on the financial soundness of these institutions, the integrity of the internal market and financial stability as a whole. Therefore prudential supervisors should consider, to the extent known to them, ML/TF risks from a prudential 13 GL ON COMMON PROCEDURES AND METHODOLOGIES FOR SREP AND SUPERVISORY STRESS TESTING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY perspective throughout their work, including in the SREP, and cooperate with the authorities and bodies responsible for ensuring compliance with AML/CFT requirements under Directive (EU) 2015/849 in this respect. The requirement for institutions to have in place policies, controls and procedures to mitigate and manage effectively the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing, is set out in Directive (EU) 2015/849. Consequently, AML/CFT supervisors are responsible for supervising the institutions' compliance with those requirements, in accordance with the risk-based approach, including that the policies, controls and procedures, which have been put in place by institutions are sufficiently robust to mitigate the ML/TF risks to which they are exposed. In addition, AML/CFT supervisors are also required to carry out their own ML/TF risk assessments of the sector and also individual institutions within the sector. Prudential competent authorities are tasked, within the SREP, with reviewing the arrangements, strategies, processes and mechanisms implemented by the institutions to comply with Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and evaluate, inter alia, the risks to which the institution is or might be exposed. In view of the specific mandate and expertise of AML/CFT supervisors, which is not expected to be duplicated by prudential supervisors, the input of AML/CFT supervisors into the SREP with regard to ML/TF risks and how effectively they are managed by institutions is important. In addition to the information available to them, prudential competent authorities should also consider information concerning ML/TF risk and other relevant input received from the AML/CFT supervisors to the extent that it affects compliance with the requirements under Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. Conversely, deficiencies in governance requirements, uncovered by the prudential competent authorities, may also imply deficiencies in the AML/CFT policies, controls and procedures, which may be relevant for AML/CFT supervision and therefore cooperation between the AML/CFT and prudential supervisors is crucial. SREP is one example where the information from AML/CFT supervision may also be beneficial for prudential supervisors and vice versa. Therefore, the outcomes of the relevant ML/TF risk assessments or findings from inspections conducted by AML/CFT supervisors should feed into the SREP, where they relate to requirements assessed by the competent authorities under Directive 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013. In the meantime, where the SREP assessment of business models, operational risk, credit risk, liquidity and funding and internal governance and institution-wide controls reveals information related to the institutions' exposure to increased ML/TF risks or the management of the ML/TF risk by institutions, the relevant information should be shared with AML/CFT supervisors to inform the supervision of the requirements under Directive (EU) 2015/849, including the imposition of AML/CFT supervisory measures or sanctions. In addition Article 97(6) of Directive 2013/36/EU requires competent authorities to immediately notify the EBA and the relevant AML/CFT supervisors where their supervisory review, in particular the evaluation of the governance arrangements, the business model, or the activities of an institution, gives competent authorities reasonable grounds to suspect that, in connection with that institution, money laundering or terrorist financing is being or has been committed or attempted, 14 GL ON COMMON PROCEDURES AND METHODOLOGIES FOR SREP AND SUPERVISORY STRESS TESTING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY or there is increased risk in this regard. In the event of potential increased risk of money laundering or terrorist financing, competent authorities and AML/CFT supervisors should liaise with each other and notify their common assessment immediately to the EBA1. Link between the SREP and early intervention measures and resolution The SREP assessment may also be used in setting triggers for early intervention measures, as provided for in Article 27 of Directive 2014/59/EU (BRRD). It also allows for the determination of an institution as 'failing or likely to fail', which activates the formal interaction procedure with resolution authorities pursuant to Article 32 of that Directive. To this end, these guidelines should be read together with the EBA Guidelines on triggers for use of early intervention measures2 and guidelines on the interpretation of the different circumstances when an institution shall be considered as failing or likely to fail3.

For the scope of proportionality, when conducting the SREP by applying these guidelines, competent authorities should recognise that different elements, methodological aspects and assessment components as provided in Titles 4, 5, 6 and 8 do not have the same relevance for all institutions; competent authorities should, where relevant, apply different degrees of granularity to the assessment depending on the category to which the institution is assigned and to the extent appropriate for the size and business model of the institution, and the nature, scale and complexity of its activities.",
            "59. Having regard to paragraphs 57 and 58, competent authorities may also determine the specific focus of SREP, where more detailed assessment is carried out in selected areas, while less scrutiny, but sufficient for meaningful assessment, is devoted to all other SREP elements. Such a focus of SREP may be based on multi-year planning, economic circumstances or specific situation of an institution. In determining the focus and granularity of the assessment, competent authorities should take into account the risk profile of the institution, the materiality of the different risks and any changes thereof, including those observed in the monitoring of key indicators as outlined in Title 3, stress testing as outlined in Title 12 or in the outcome of previous SREP assessments. 36 Title 3.Monitoring of key indicators",
            "60. Competent authorities should engage in regular monitoring of key financial and non-financial indicators to monitor changes in the financial conditions and risk profiles of institutions. Competent authorities should also use this monitoring to identify the need for updates to the assessment of SREP elements in light of new material information outside of planned supervisory activities. Where monitoring reveals a material change in the risk profile of the institution, or any anomalies in the indicators, competent authorities should investigate the causes, and, where relevant, review the assessment of the relevant SREP element in light of the new information.",

Following the model of minimum engagement discussed in Title 2, competent authorities should monitor key financial and non-financial indicators at least on a quarterly basis for all institutions. However, depending on the specific features of the institutions or situation, competent authorities may establish more frequent monitoring, taking into consideration the availability of the underlying information (e.g. market data).",
            "62. Competent authorities should establish monitoring systems and patterns allowing for the identification of material changes and anomalies in the behaviour of indicators, and should set thresholds, where relevant. Competent authorities should also establish escalation procedures for all relevant indicators (or combinations of indicators) covered by the monitoring to ensure that anomalies and material changes are investigated.",
            "63. Competent authorities should tailor the set of indicators and their thresholds to the specific features of individual institutions or groups of institutions with similar characteristics (peer groups). The framework of indicators, monitoring patterns and thresholds should reflect the institution's size, complexity, business model and risk profile and should cover geographies, sectors and markets where the institution operates.",
            "64. Competent authorities should identify the indicators to be tracked through regular monitoring primarily from regular supervisory reporting and using definitions from common reporting standards. Where relevant, EBA dashboards or indicators being monitored by the EBA may be used as a source of information against which individual institutions can be monitored.",

Identification of material changes or anomalies in indicators, especially in cases where changes are outliers to the peer-group performance, should be considered by competent authorities as a prompt for further investigation. Specifically, competent authorities should: a. determine the cause and make an assessment of materiality of the potential prudential impact on the institution; b. document the cause and the outcome of the assessment; and c. review the risk assessment and SREP score, where relevant, in light of any new findings.",

Without undermining the responsibility of the institution's management body for running and organising the business, or indicating preferences for specific business models, competent authorities should conduct regular business model analysis (BMA) to assess business and strategic risks and determine: the viability of the institution's current business model on the basis of its ability to generate acceptable returns over the following 12 months; and the sustainability of the institution's strategy on the basis of its ability to generate acceptable returns over a forward-looking period of at least 3 years, based on its strategic plans and financial forecasts.",

Competent authorities may assess specific aspects of the BMA, in particular the quantitative assessment of the business model, as part of the assessment of other SREP elements (e.g. understanding the funding structure can be part of the risks to liquidity assessment).",
            "73. Competent authorities should also use the BMA to support the identification of the institution's key vulnerabilities, which are most likely to have a material impact on the institution/lead to its failure in the future.",
            "74. Competent authorities should also use the BMA to assess prudential implications of ML/TF risks known to them, linked to the business model of the institution. In this respect, competent authorities should use the input received from AML/CFT supervisors, in particular their assessments of ML/TF risks and any findings relating to material weaknesses in an institution's AML/CFT controls, to complement their findings from ongoing supervision, and evaluate whether they give rise to prudential concerns related to ML/TF risk. Where the assessment indicates the business model of the institution gives rise to prudential concerns related to ML/TF risk, competent authorities should share the outcome of the prudential assessment of the business model with the AML/CFT supervisors17."

In the assessment of the soundness of the ICAAP and ILAAP, competent authorities should consider, where relevant: a. whether methodologies and assumptions applied by institutions are appropriate and consistent across risks, are grounded in solid empirical input data, use robustly calibrated parameters and are applied equally for risk measurement and capital and liquidity management; b. whether the confidence level is consistent with the risk appetite and whether the internal diversification assumptions reflect the business model and the risk strategies; c. whether the definition and composition of available internal capital or liquidity resources considered by the institution for the ICAAP and ILAAP are consistent with the risks measured by the institution and are eligible for the calculation of own funds and liquidity buffers; and d. whether the distribution/allocation of available internal capital and liquidity resources among business lines or legal entities properly reflects the risk to which each of them is or may be exposed, and properly takes into account any legal or operational constraints on the transferability of these resources."

Furthermore, supervisory assessments of institutions' stress testing programmes, and the outcomes of various stress tests performed by an institution as part of its stress testing programme, could inform the assessment of various SREP elements and, in particular: 62 a. The identification of possible vulnerabilities or weaknesses in risk management and controls on individual risk areas. These should be used as an additional source of information to be taken into account by the competent authorities when assessing individual risks to capital as referred to in Title 6 of these Guidelines, or risks to liquidity and funding as referred to in Title 8 of these Guidelines. Scenario and sensitivity analyses performed by an institution can be used to assess the exposure to individual risks and the related sensitivities to underlying risk factors. b. The identification of possible deficiencies in overall governance arrangements or institution-wide controls. These should be considered by competent authorities as an additional source of information for the purposes of the SREP assessment of internal governance and institution-wide controls. Furthermore, the results of an institution's stress tests can be used in assessing the institution's capital planning, and in particular its time dimension. c.

            "131. When assessing stress testing programmes, the results of stress tests and proposed management actions, competent authorities should consider both idiosyncratic and system- wide perspectives. In particular, management actions should be primarily assessed from an internal perspective with regard to their plausibility, considering the specificities of an individual institution. Competent authorities should also consider management actions from a system-wide perspective, as other institutions are likely to consider similar actions, which in a system-wide context may be implausible.",

In their reviews of stress tests performed in the context of capital and liquidity risk management, including for ICAAP and ILAAP purposes, competent authorities should carry out a combined assessment of the impact of stress test outcomes on capital and liquidity needs, as well as on other relevant regulatory requirements. To that end, competent authorities should assess whether the institution is able to maintain the applicable TSCR, at all times, in an adverse scenario and if it has identified a set of management actions to address any potential breaches of TSCR.",

To do so, competent authorities should leverage the knowledge gained from the assessment of other SREP elements, from the comparison of the institution's position to peers and from any other supervisory activities.",
            "242. As a minimum, competent authorities should consider: a. the institution's market activities, business lines and products; b. the main strategy of the market risk portfolio and the risk appetite in market activities; 98 c. the relative weight of market risk positions in terms of total assets, changes over time and the institution's strategy for these positions; d. the relative weight of net gains on market positions in total operating income; and e. the own funds requirement for market risk compared to the total own funds requirement, and - where relevant - the internal capital allocated for market risk compared to the total internal capital, including the historical change in this figure and forecasts.",
            "243. In their initial assessments, competent authorities should also consider significant changes in the institution's market activities with the focus on potential changes in the total exposure to market risk. As a minimum, they should assess: a. significant changes in market risk strategy, policies and sizes of limits; b. the potential impact on the institution's risk profile of those changes; and c. major trends in the financial markets and the institution's strategy towards it (including potential risks in case the trends unexpectedly reverse). Nature and composition of the institution's market risk activities",

While analysing market risk activities, competent authorities should also consider the complexity of the financial products (e.g. over-the-counter (OTC) products or products valued using mark-to-model techniques) and of specific market operations (e.g. high-frequency trading). The following points should be considered: a. if the institution holds derivatives positions, competent authorities should assess both the market value and the notional amount; and b. when the institution is engaged in OTC derivatives, competent authorities should evaluate the weight of these transactions in the total derivatives portfolio and the breakdown of the OTC portfolio by type of contract (swap, forward, etc.), underlying financial instruments, etc. (the counterparty credit risk associated with these products is covered under the credit risk methodology). 99",

            "248. For those institutions using the internal model approach (IMA) to calculate their regulatory own funds requirements, competent authorities should also consider the following indicators to identify particular risk areas and related risk drivers: a. the split of market risk own funds requirements between the value at risk (VaR), stressed VaR (SVaR), incremental risk charge (IRC) and charge for correlation trading portfolio; b. the VaR broken down by risk factors; c. the change in the VaR and SVaR (possible indicators could be the day-to-day/week- to-week change, the quarterly average and back-testing results); and d. the multiplication factors applied to VaR and SVAR e. the results of the calculations performed for the purpose of the specific reporting requirements for market risk, based on using the alternative standardised approach set out in Chapter 1a of Title IV of Part Three of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013; and f. where relevant, the results of the calculations performed for the purpose of the specific reporting requirements for market risk, based on using the alternative internal model approach (IMA) set out in Chapter 1b of Title IV of Part Three of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.",

Where possible, this analysis should be completed with a comparison of the institution's figures to peers and to relevant macroeconomic indicators. Profitability analysis",
            "251. Competent authorities should analyse the historic profitability, including volatility of profits, of market activities to gain a better understanding of the institution's market risk profile.

For those asset classes and/or exposures generating abnormal profits or losses, competent authorities should assess profitability in comparison to the level of risk assumed by the institution (e.g. VaR/net gains on financial assets and liabilities held for trading) to identify and analyse possible inconsistencies. Where possible, competent authorities should compare the institution's figures to its historical performance and its peers. Market concentration risk",

When evaluating possible concentrations, competent authorities should pay special attention to concentrations in complex products (e.g. structured products), illiquid products (e.g. collateralised debt obligations (CDOs)) or products valued using mark-to-model techniques. Stress testing",
            "256. When evaluating the inherent market risk of an institution, competent authorities should take into account the results of stress tests performed by the institution to identify any previously unidentified sources of market risk. This is especially important for tail-risk events, which may be underrepresented or entirely absent from historical data because of their low frequency of occurrence. Another source of potential hidden vulnerabilities that competent authorities should consider is the potential for jumps in pricing parameters, such as a sudden change in certain prices or price bubbles in commodities."

As a minimum, competent authorities should consider: a. the main strategy for operational risk and operational risk appetite; 34 Commission Delegated Regulation(EU) 2018/959 of 14 March 2018 supplementing Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards of the specification of the assessment methodology under which competent authorities permit institutions to use Advanced Measurement Approaches for operational risk (OJ L 169, 6.7.2018, p. 1). 110 b. the business and external environments (including geographical location of the parent company and its entities as well as of ICT operations and data centres) in which the institution operates and distribution channels used; c. the own funds requirement for operational risk (distinguished by the basic indicator approach (BIA), the standardised approach (TSA) and the advanced measurement approaches (AMA)) compared to the total own funds requirement, and - where relevant - the internal capital for operational risk compared to the total internal capital, taking into account the historical trends and forecasts, if available; d. the level of and change in gross income, assets and operational risk losses over the past few years at the aggregated level but also for material entities and business lines; e. recent significant corporate events (such as mergers, acquisitions, disposals and restructuring), which might determine a change in the institution's operational risk profile in the short or medium to long term (e.g. because systems, processes and procedures would not be fully aligned with the risk management policies of the parent undertaking in the short term); f. changes to significant elements of the IT systems and/or of processes that might determine a change in the operational risk profile (e.g. because a new or changed IT system has not been properly tested, or because insufficient training on the new systems/processes and procedures might lead to errors); g. failures to comply with applicable legislation or with internal regulations as reported by other supervisors (including AML/CFT supervisors), external auditors and the internal audit function or brought to light by public information (bearing in mind both the current situation and changes in regulatory compliance behaviour over time); h. the ambitiousness of business plans and aggressive incentives and compensation schemes (e.g. in terms of sales targets, including accepting customers identified as high ML/TF risk by the institution or expansion to high ML/TF risk jurisdictions or distribution of new products/services bearing a high level of inherent ML/TF risk, headcount reduction, etc.), which might increase the risk of non-compliance, human error and employee malpractice; i. the processes, procedures, products (sold to customers or dealt in)and IT systems (including the use of new technologies), to the extent that they might lead to incidents, errors, delays, misspecification, security breaches, increased exposure to fraud, ML/TF and other types of financial crime, etc .; and 111 j. the potential impact of outsourcing arrangements, and in general all arrangements with third parties, on institutions' operational risk as well as the institutions' oversight on the performance of the service providers in delivering all the outsourced services, including the level of awareness of operational risk related to outsourced activities and of service providers' overall risk exposure in line with the EBA Guidelines on outsourcing arrangements.",
            "281. Where relevant, the competent authority should analyse the aspects above by business line/legal entity and geography as well as by event type category, provided that data are available, and compare the institution's position to its peers. Nature of operational risk exposures",
            "82. Competent authorities should determine the nature of operational risk exposures by analysing exposures to the main drivers of operational risk to form a forward-looking view on potential risk and losses. Such an analysis may require consideration of business lines, products, processes and geographies relevant to the institution, as well as an assessment of operational risk exposures to primary risk drivers (e.g. processes, people, systems and external factors), with use of the institution's self-risk assessment and peer analysis.",
            "283. In performing this analysis, competent authorities should consider the interactions of such risk drivers in determining the institution's operational risk exposures (e.g. exposure to more risk drivers might increase the likelihood of an operational event and consequent loss, including the possibility to impose sanctions). Significance of operational risk exposure",
            "284. Once the major sources and drivers of operational risk have been identified, the competent authority should focus on those that might have the most material impact on the institution. The competent authority should assess the institution's 'potential exposure' to the operational risk by using both expert judgement and qualitative and quantitative indicators relating to either the institution or its peers, and also include information from other supervisors (e.g. AML/CFT supervisors).",
            "285. In assessing the significance of operational risk exposures, competent authorities should consider both the frequency and the severity of the events to which the institution is exposed, and distinguish those causing high-severity losses and those occurring with high frequencies. Based on this distinction, competent authorities should assess the trends of operational risk losses and their concentration.",
            "286. A primary source of information competent authorities should consider is the institution's operational losses and event database, which, where available and reliable (i.e. accurate and complete), provides the historical operational risk profile of the institution. 112",
            "287. For institutions adopting internal models for operational risk, the competent authority should also consider the output of the internal approach, provided that this approach is capable of measuring the operational risk exposure in the desired level of detail (e.g. product, process, etc.) and assuming that the model is sufficiently forward-looking. However, competent authorities should also take into account the limitations and potential weaknesses of the internal models.",
            "288. In addition, competent authorities should perform a more qualitative analysis and leverage the institution's risk assessment, peer analysis data and public and/or consortium databases, if available and relevant. Competent authorities may also consider other factors, specific to the relevant business units, etc. affected by the potential deficiencies, which can provide a measure of the risk exposure.",
            "289. In performing the assessment of an institution's risk exposure, competent authorities should employ a forward-looking approach, leveraging scenario analyses performed by the institution, where available, and taking into consideration any corrective measures and mitigation actions already implemented and effective. Assessment of operational risk subcategories",
            "290. Competent authorities should identify and assess operational risk across all operational risk subcategories (including those defined by event types and further breakdowns of these event types) and the associated risk drivers. Competent authorities should focus the assessment on those subcategories, which are considered the most significant for the institution. The significance of a subcategory should be evaluated by leveraging the quantitative information collected during the preliminary assessment, including the level of losses per subcategory with regard to capital requirement and gross income. Competent authorities should also apply their expert judgement to identify significant subcategories, based on all available internal and external information sources.",
            "291. In conducting the assessment, competent authorities should pay particular attention to some specific aspects of operational risk because of their pervasive nature and their relevance to the majority of institutions, and also because of their potential prudential impact. Such aspects which should always be in the focus of assessment include: a. ICT risk; b. conduct risk; and c. model risk. ICT risk 113",
            "292. Competent authorities should assess the ICT risk in accordance with the EBA Guidelines on ICT Risk Assessment under the SREP35 and having regard to the EBA Guidelines on ICT and security risk management, taking into account that ICT risk is a key driver of operational risk. Conduct risk",
            "293. Competent authorities should assess the relevance and significance of the institution's exposures to conduct risk, considering the factors listed in points a to g which are relevant to the institution. For Category-1 and Category-2 institutions, competent authorities should consider all of the following: a. mis-selling of products, in both retail and wholesale markets, including pushed cross-selling of products to retail customers, such as packaged bank accounts or add-on products customers do not need; b. conflicts of interest in conducting business; c. manipulation of benchmark interest rates, foreign exchange rates or any other financial instruments or indices to enhance the institution's profits; d. barriers to switching financial products during their lifetime and/or to switching financial service providers; e. poorly designed distribution channels that may enable conflicts of interest with false incentives; f. automatic renewals of products or exit penalties; and/or g. unfair processing of customer complaints.",
            "294. Since conduct risk covers a wide range of issues and may arise from many business processes and products, competent authorities should leverage the outcome of the BMA and scrutinise incentive policies to gain a high-level insight into sources of conduct risk.",
            "295. Where relevant, the competent authority should consider the level of competition in the markets in which the institution operates and determine whether any dominant position, either alone or within a small group, presents a material risk of misconduct (e.g. as a result of cartel- like behaviour).",
            "296. Possible indicators to flag the existence of conduct risk are: a. sanctions applied by relevant authorities to the institution for misconduct practices;"

Under the operational risk competent authorities should assess two distinct forms of model risk: a. risk relating to the underestimation of own funds requirements by regulatory advanced measurement approaches; and b. risk of losses relating to the development, implementation or improper use of any other models by the institution for decision-making (e.g. product pricing, evaluation of financial instruments, monitoring of risk limits, etc.), where competent authorities should establish an overview of such models and evaluate their significance and assess the model risk management framework adopted by the institution.",

For the purpose of point (b) of paragraph 298 competent authorities should consider: a. to what extent and for which purposes the institution uses models to make decisions and the business significance of such decisions. Competent authorities should determine the business/activity for which the institution makes material use of models. In conducting this assessment, competent authorities may look at the following areas, where institutions commonly make extensive use of models: i. trading in financial instruments (including assets evaluation and trading strategies); ii. risk measurement and management; and iii. capital allocation (including lending policies and product pricing). 115 b. the institution's level of awareness of and how it manages model risk by assessing whether: i. the institution has implemented control mechanisms (e.g. market- parameter calibration, internal validation or back-testing, counter- checking with expert judgement, etc.)that are sound in terms of methods, frequency, follow-up, etc., and that include a model approval process; and ii. the institution uses models in a conservative manner (e.g. by increasing or decreasing relevant parameters based on the direction of the positions, etc.) if it is aware of model deficiencies or market and business developments.",

            "328. Competent authorities should consider the relevance and materiality of at least the following subcategories when assessing IRRBB: a. Gap risk - risk resulting from the term structure of interest rate sensitive instruments that arises from differences in the timing of their rate changes, covering changes to the term structure of interest rates occurring consistently across the yield curve (parallel risk) or differentially by period (non-parallel risk). b. Basis risk - risk arising from the impact of relative changes in interest rates on interest rate sensitive instruments that have similar tenors but are priced using different interest rate indices. It arises from the imperfect correlation in the adjustment of the rates earned and paid on different interest rate sensitive instruments with otherwise similar rate change characteristics. c. Option risk - risk arising from options (embedded and explicit), whereby the institution or its customer can alter the level and timing of their cash flows, namely 126 the risk arising from interest rate sensitive instruments where the holder will almost certainly exercise the option if it is in their financial interest to do so (embedded or explicit automatic options) and the risk arising from flexibility embedded implicitly or within the terms of interest rate sensitive instruments, such that changes in interest rates may affect a change in the behaviour of the client (embedded behavioural option risk).",

This applies particularly to the institution's internal interest rate risk identification, evaluation, management and mitigation.",

Assessment of IRRBB should be differentiated from assessment of credit spread risk arising from positions in the non-trading book (commonly referred to as CSRBB) that competent authorities should also conduct. In particular, competent authorities should take into account whether institutions' internal systems adequately assess and monitor the risk from CSRBB from an economic value and net interest income perspective39."

When setting additional own funds requirements for the risk of unexpected losses pursuant to point (a) of paragraph 366, competent authorities should consider each type of risk that may pose a material risk to the institution's capital. Competent authorities should set additional own funds required to cover the risk of unexpected losses by determining the capital considered adequate to cover the type of risk and deducting the relevant part of own funds requirements set out in Parts Three and Four of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and Chapter 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/2402.",
            "368. For the purpose of the previous paragraph, competent authorities should determine on a risk-by-risk basis, the amounts of capital considered adequate, by identifying, assessing and quantifying the risks to which the institution is exposed and they should take into account the full risk profile of an institution. The determination of the amounts of capital considered adequate should include: a. institution-specific risks or elements of such risks that are explicitly excluded from or not explicitly addressed by the Pillar 1 own funds requirements; b. institution-specific risks or elements of such risks that are considered not to be sufficiently covered by the applicable Pillar 1 own funds requirements.",
            "369. Competent authorities should ensure that the amount of capital considered adequate to cover each risk identified in accordance with Articles 79 to 85 of Directive 2013/36/EU is not lower than the relevant part of the applicable Pillar 1 own funds requirement covering that risk. In exceptional cases where it is overly burdensome, especially for small institutions, to meaningfully disentangle the amount of capital considered adequate for two or more types of risk quantified together, competent authorities should comply with the first sentence of this paragraph on a best-effort basis, using the ICAAP calculations, supervisory judgement and other sources of information, by determining the level of additional own funds requirements in a conservative manner, having regard to paragraphs 372 to 374.",
            "370. The identification, assessment and quantification of risks to which the institution is exposed should be supported by the following sources of information: a. the ICAAP and the outcomes of its assessment by the competent authority, including the ICAAP calculations where deemed reliable or partially reliable in accordance with paragraphs 375 to 377; b. supervisory reporting; c. the outcome of supervisory assessment and benchmarking; d. the outcomes of any relevant previous supervisory activities; and e. other relevant inputs, including those arising from interaction and dialogue with the institution. 141",
            "371. The ICAAP and outcomes of its assessment should be taken into account by competent authorities as one of the key inputs for the identification and assessment of risks relevant for the institution. The determination of the amount of capital considered adequate and additional own funds requirements on a risk-by-risk basis should take into account the ICAAP calculations if deemed reliable or partially reliable, as well as the outcomes of supervisory benchmarking and other relevant inputs as appropriate, including the supervisory judgement.",
            "372. Competent authorities should not allow own funds held pursuant to Article 92 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 to be used to meet or offset additional own funds requirements both on an aggregate and on a risk-by-risk basis.",
            "373. For the purposes of Article 98(1), point (f) of Directive 2013/36/EU and the determination of additional own funds requirements, competent authorities should assess and consider diversification effects arising from geographical, sectoral or any other relevant drivers within each material risk category (intra-risk diversification). For each of the risks to capital covered by Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, such diversification effects should not reduce the minimum own funds requirements calculated in accordance with Article 92 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.",
            "374. However, diversification between risks in different categories, including those covered by Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (inter-risk diversification) should not be considered as part of the determination of additional own funds requirements. ICAAP calculations",
            "375. Competent authorities should assess the reliability of the ICAAP calculations by assessing whether they are: a. Granular: the calculations/methodologies should allow the calculations to be broken down by risk type, rather than presenting a single (economic capital) calculation covering all risks. This breakdown should be enabled by the ICAAP methodology itself. Risks should not be excluded from the ICAAP where they are difficult to quantify or where relevant data are not available; estimates may be provided based on available information and including expert judgement. Where deemed appropriate by the competent authority, estimates may be provided through marginal contribution calculations, for example, for risks that cannot be measured on a standalone basis (e.g. credit concentration risk). b. Credible: the calculations/methodologies used should demonstrably cover the risk they are looking to address (e.g. the credit concentration risk calculation should use appropriate sector breakdowns that reflect actual correlations and portfolio compositions) and should be sufficiently robust, stable, risk sensitive and conservative to adequately quantify losses associated with the risks. Such 142 calculations/methodologies should be consistent with the institutions' strategic processes, including the institutions' risk appetite. c. Understandable: the underlying drivers of the calculations/methodologies should be clearly specified. A 'black box' calculation should not be acceptable. Competent authorities should ensure that the institution provides an explanation of the key assumptions used, including at least time horizon, confidence levels, correlation assumptions, key parameters, the most fallible areas of the models used, and how these are accounted for and corrected in the final ICAAP calculation. d. Comparable: the calculations/methodologies should clearly mention the main assumptions in terms of the overall level of conservatism, the holding periods/risk horizons and confidence levels (or equivalent measurement) in order to allow the adjustment that may be requested or enacted by competent authorities in order to facilitate comparability with peers and supervisory benchmarking.",
            "376. Competent authorities should further assess the reliability of the ICAAP calculations by comparing them against the outcome of the supervisory benchmarks for the same risks, and other relevant inputs.",
            "377. An ICAAP calculation should be considered partially reliable where, despite not meeting all the above criteria, the calculation still seems highly credible, though this should be on an exceptional basis and accompanied by steps to improve deficiencies identified in the ICAAP calculation. Supervisory benchmarks",
            "378. Competent authorities should develop and apply risk-specific supervisory benchmarks as a means to challenge ICAAP calculations for those material risks, or elements of such risks, that are not covered or not sufficiently covered by Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, or to further support the determination of risk-by-risk additional own funds requirement, especially where ICAAP calculations for those material risks, or elements of such risks, are deemed unreliable or are unavailable.",
            "379. The supervisory benchmarks should be developed to provide a prudent, consistent (i.e., as applicable, calibrated to equivalent holding periods/risk horizons and confidence levels as required by Regulation (EU) No 575/2013), transparent and comparable measure with which to calculate and compare across institutions the capital considered adequate for a given type of risk.",
            "380. Given the variety of different business models operated by institutions, the outcome of the supervisory benchmarks may not be appropriate in every instance for every institution. Competent authorities should address this by using the most appropriate benchmark where alternatives are available, and by applying judgement to the outcome of the benchmark to account for business-model-specific and institution-specific considerations. 143",
            "381. When competent authorities take supervisory benchmarks into consideration for the determination of additional own funds requirements, as part of the dialogue, they should explain to the institution the rationale and general underlying principles behind the benchmarks. Other relevant inputs",
            "382. Competent authorities should use other relevant inputs to support the determination of risk-by-risk additional own funds requirements. Other relevant inputs may include the outcomes of risk assessments (following the criteria specified in Title 6), peer-group comparisons, including report(s) issued by the EBA pursuant to the requirements of Article 78 of Directive 2013/36/EU, benchmarks issued by the EBA pursuant to Article 101 of Directive 2013/36/EU, etc.",
            "383. Other relevant inputs should prompt the competent authority to reassess the appropriateness/reliability of an ICAAP/supervisory benchmarks for a specific risk, and/or make adjustments to the outcome, where they prompt doubts about its accuracy (e.g. where the risk score implies a significantly different level of risk relative to the calculation, or where peer reviews reveal that the institution differs significantly from peers in terms of the own funds requirement to cover a comparable risk exposure).",
            "384. To ensure consistency in determining additional risk-by-risk own funds requirements, competent authorities should use the same peer groups established to analyse risks to capital as specified in Title 6.",
            "385. When competent authorities take other relevant inputs into consideration for the determination of additional own funds requirements, as part of the dialogue, they should explain to the institution the rationale and general underlying principles behind the inputs used."

            "421. To assess capital adequacy in stressed conditions, competent authorities should consider: a. the use of the qualitative outcomes (e.g. deficiencies identified in risk management and control) of institutions' stress tests and supervisory stress testing; and b. the use of the quantitative outcomes of institutions' stress tests, if the ICAAP is deemed reliable in accordance with paragraph 375, and of supervisory stress tests (i.e. outcomes in terms of changes in own funds ratios), pursuant to Article 100 of Directive 2013/36/EU as specified in Title 12 of these guidelines, and including, for example: i. prescribing specific 'anchor' scenarios/assumptions to be implemented by institutions; and ii. conducting system-wide stress tests using consistent methodologies and scenarios run either by institutions or by supervisors.",

            "423. Competent authorities should determine P2G and P2G-LR as specified in this section, and, where the determination leads to a positive value, they should set P2G or P2G-LR to address supervisory concerns about the sensitivity of the institution to the adverse scenarios used in the supervisory stress tests.",
            "424. P2G is the amount of capital that should be set to reach the overall level of own funds considered appropriate under the SREP and the outcomes of supervisory stress tests. The level of P2G should protect against the potential breach of TSCR in the adverse scenario The level of P2G-LR should protect against the breach of TSLRR in the adverse scenario. Where the quantitative outcomes of the supervisory stress tests suggest that the institution is not expected to breach its TSCR under the adverse stress test scenario, competent authorities may decide not to set P2G. Similarly, competent authorities may decide not to set P2G-LR where TSLRR is not expected to be breached under the adverse stress test scenario.",
            "425. Competent authorities should determine and set P2G and P2G-LR based on the outcomes of the adverse scenario of the relevant supervisory stress tests, including the EU-wide stress tests performed by the EBA or any other relevant supervisory stress tests performed on a system-wide basis using a multi-factor scenario analysis over a forward-looking horizon of at least 2 years (either top-down or bottom-up).",
            "426. On the basis of establishing a proportionate approach for non-Category 1 institutions and subsidiaries of cross-border groups, for setting and updating P2G and P2G-LR competent authorities may consider the outcomes of simplified forms of supervisory stress tests (e.g. through the use of supervisory prescribed 'anchor' scenarios, sensitivity analysis, top-down stress tests conducted by designated authorities, portfolio level impacts from consolidated level stress tests), past supervisory stress tests or institutions' stress tests in accordance with paragraph 421. The simplified forms of supervisory stress tests may be carried out on an individual basis rather than as part of the system-wide exercise.",
            "427. Competent authorities should determine and set P2G and P2G-LR in accordance with the minimum engagement model specified in Section 2.2.4. In particular, the minimum frequency with which P2G and P2G-LR are determined and set should be the frequency of the capital adequacy assessment under the SREP minimum-engagement model. In particular, the simplified forms of supervisory stress tests as referred to in paragraph 426426 are not expected to have a greater frequency than the SREP, unless this is considered necessary by the competent authority.",
            "428. Notwithstanding the previous paragraph, competent authorities: 153 a. should assess whether the existing P2G and P2G-LR level is still appropriate whenever the results of new supervisory stress tests are available, and revise the level of P2G and P2G-LR if necessary; b. may determine P2G and P2G-LR only every second year instead of annually, including for institutions for which capital adequacy, according to the SREP minimum engagement model, should be assessed annually (e.g. SREP Category 1 institutions). However, in the year that follows the year of determining P2G, competent authorities should assess, on the basis of all relevant information, including outcomes of past supervisory stress tests, together with additional sensitivity analysis (i.e. simplified forms of supervisory stress testing), whether P2G and P2G-LR are still relevant or need to be updated.",
            "429. Competent authorities should generally not use P2G to cover aspects of risks that should be covered by the additional own funds requirements in accordance with Section 7.2 of these guidelines. Similarly, P2G-LR should not cover those aspects of risk of excessive leverage that are covered by the additional own funds requirements in accordance with Section 7.3 of these guidelines.",
            "430. When determining the size of P2G, competent authorities should ensure that it is set at a level appropriate to cover at least the anticipated maximum stress impact, which should be calculated based on the changes in the CET1 ratio (i.e. considering both movements in CET1 capital and TREA) in the worst year of stress and taking into account the level of applicable capital requirements and the considerations set out in paragraphs 422422 and 432 to 436. The maximum stress impact for the purpose of setting the P2G should be understood as the difference between the lowest CET1 ratio in the adverse scenario over the stress test horizon and the actual CET1 ratio at the starting point. With regard to the determination of the size of P2G-LR, the maximum stress impact should be calculated based on the changes in the Tier 1 capital in the worst year of stress and taking into account the applicable leverage ratio capital requirements. The maximum stress impact for the purpose of setting the P2G-LR should be understood as the difference between the lowest leverage ratio in the adverse scenario over the stress test horizon and the actual leverage ratio at the starting point.",
            "431. Competent authorities should obtain the P2G starting point specific for each institution by offsetting elements that already cover risks reflected in the maximum stress impact. In particular, competent authorities should offset the relevant measures, in particular capital conservation buffer, as specified in paragraph 435435. In addition, when setting the P2G and P2G-LR starting points, competent authorities may consider, where relevant, other adjustments to the maximum stress impact related to the static balance sheet assumption or the different time horizon between the stress test exercise and the time of the starting point.",
            "432. Where setting the P2G and P2G-LR, competent authorities should ensure an adequate link between the P2G and P2G-LR starting points and, respectively, the final P2G and P2G-LR. For this purpose, they may decide to use a bucketing approach to classify institutions according to 154 the P2G and P2G-LR starting points, based on the relevant supervisory stress tests set out in paragraph 425 or based on other approaches set out in paragraph 426. Consequently, competent authorities may assign a fixed range of respectively P2G or P2G-LR levels to each bucket and set the final P2G and P2G-LR within the range of the assigned bucket or, exceptionally, outside the range of the relevant bucket, based on the institution-specific considerations. Competent authorities should aim to avoid cliff effects between buckets, for instance by allowing partial overlap between the P2G or P2G-LR levels for neighbouring bucket, and they should ensure that the resulting final P2G and P2G-LR are institution-specific.",
            "433. When determining the final P2G and P2G-LR, competent authorities should consider, where relevant, the following factors: a. the year when the maximum stress impact occurs in relation to the starting point and time horizon of the scenarios used in the stress tests; b. the outcome of a reliable institution stress test, taking into account the specific scenario definitions and assumptions, in particular where they are deemed more relevant for the business model and risk profile of the institution or where the internal scenarios are more severe than the supervisory scenarios; c. changes occurring after the cut-off date of the stress test exercise with a material impact on the institutions' risk profile or capital position (e.g. sale of non- performing loans). These changes may include interim changes of the risk profile including structural changes in the institutions' activity or balance sheet; d. relevant management mitigating actions of the institution that are deemed credible and highly certain following their supervisory assessment; e. information about and supervisory views on the relevance of supervisory stress testing to the institution's strategy, financial plans and business model; f. reduced certainty on the actual sensitivity of the institution to adverse scenarios; g. any potential overlaps with the P2R or P2R-LR; h. the institution's overall recovery capacity as specified in Article 12(3) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1075 43, where the institution's calculation is considered sufficiently reliable and realistic; i. the quality (composition) of the institution's available own funds, including at the worst year of stress; and 43 Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1075 of 23 March 2016 supplementing Directive 2014/59/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to regulatory technical standards specifying the content of recovery plans. 155 j. whether or not the institution is under restructuring or resolution.",
            "434. For the purpose of determining P2G in accordance with paragraph 433.b, competent authorities should also consider the extent to which stress scenarios cover all the material risks contributing to the additional own funds requirements in TSCR. Competent authorities should in particular have regard to the fact that macroeconomic downturn scenarios may not entirely capture some risks, for example conduct risk, pension risk or some elements of credit concentration risk (e.g. single name concentration), that may amplify potential losses under the tested adverse scenarios.",
            "435. In addition, competent authorities should consider the extent to which the existing combined buffer requirements and other applicable measures already cover risks revealed by stress testing. Competent authorities should offset P2G against the capital conservation buffer (CCB), as P2G and the CCB overlap in nature. Furthermore, while no overlap is in principle expected between P2G and the countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB), competent authorities should, in exceptional cases, offset P2G on a case-by-case basis against the CCyB based on the consideration of underlying risks covered by the buffer and factored into the design of the scenarios used for the stress tests, after liaising with the macroprudential authority. Competent authorities should not offset P2G against the systemic risk buffers (G-SII/O-SII buffers and the systemic risk buffer), as those are intended to cover the risks an institution poses to the financial system. Similarly, competent authorities should not offset P2G-LR against the G-SII leverage ratio buffer requirement specified in Article 92(1a) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.",
            "436. Where competent authorities determine P2G, they should add this guidance on top of the OCR. Where competent authorities determine P2G-LR, they should add this guidance on top of OLRR. Competent authorities should consider OCR and OLRR as two separate stacks of requirements. Consequently, the available own funds can simultaneously be used to meet P2G and P2G-LR. Communication and composition of P2G and P2G-LR",
            "437. When communicating P2G or P2G-LR to institutions, competent authorities should justify their decisions. The justification should be institution-specific and should highlight the main elements of the methodology used to determine P2G or P2G-LR.",
            "438. Where P2G or P2G-LR is set or updated, competent authorities should communicate to the institution their levels and the relevant time limits for its establishment in accordance with paragraph 442442. Competent authorities should also explain the potential supervisory reaction to situations where P2G or P2G-LR is not met.",
            "439. Competent authorities should communicate to institutions that P2G should be met with CET1 eligible own funds and P2G-LR should be met in Tier 1 eligible own funds. Both P2G and 156 P2G-LR should be incorporated into their capital planning and risk management frameworks, including the risk appetite framework and recovery planning.",
            "440. Competent authorities should also communicate to institutions that own funds held for the purposes of P2G cannot be used to meet any of the elements of OCR and that P2G-LR cannot be used to meet any of the elements of OLRR.",
            "441. Competent authorities should additionally communicate to institutions and where relevant, other competent authorities, all applicable own funds ratios affected by P2G (CET1, T1 and total own funds) and leverage ratio requirement affected by P2G-LR.",
            "442. When setting and communicating to the institutions time limits to establish P2G or P2G-LR, competent authorities should consider at least the following: a. whether or not an institution is under the restructuring or resolution; and b. the potential implications that CET1 denominated P2G or P2G-LR may have for other parts of the capital requirements and the ability of institutions to issue additional Tier 1 (AT1) or Tier 2 (T2) instruments."

In particular, where the quantitative outcomes of the stress tests indicate that the institution is likely to breach its applicable capital requirements under the adverse scenario within the following 12 months, the competent authorities should, where appropriate, treat such information as one of the possible circumstances within the meaning of Article 102(1)(b) of Directive 2013/36/EU. In such cases, the competent authorities should apply appropriate measures in accordance with Article 104(1) of Directive 2013/36/EU aimed at ensuring sufficient levels of own funds.

Example 2: the supervisory minimum survival period is set at 3 months. An alternative measure to setting a minimum survival period, which can also address the supervisory concern that the gap between inflows and outflows is unacceptably high, is to set a cap on outflows. In the figure below, the mechanism for setting a cap on outflows is shown by the black horizontal bar. An institution is required to reduce its outflows to a level below the cap. The cap can be set for one or more time buckets and for net outflows (following correction for inflows) or gross outflows. The alternative of adding a buffer requirement instead is shown in the third column: Figure 7.

To articulate the specific quantitative liquidity requirements appropriately, competent authorities should use one of the following approaches, unless another approach is considered more appropriate in specific circumstances: a. Approach 1 - require an LCR higher than the regulatory minimum, of such a size that shortcomings identified are sufficiently mitigated; b. Approach 2 - require a minimum survival period of such a length that identified shortcomings are sufficiently mitigated; the survival period can be set either directly, as a requirement, or indirectly, by setting a cap on the amount of outflows over the relevant time buckets considered; competent authorities may require different types of liquid assets (e.g. assets eligible for central banks), to cover risks not (adequately) covered by the LCR; 192 c. Approach 3 - require a minimum total amount of liquid assets or counterbalancing capacity, either as a minimum total amount or as a minimum amount in excess of the applicable regulatory minimum, of such a size that identified shortcomings are sufficiently mitigated; competent authorities may set requirements for the composition of liquid assets, including operational requirements (e.g. direct convertibility to cash, or deposit of the liquid assets at the central bank).",

To ensure there is consistency, competent authorities should structure specific quantitative liquidity requirements in such a manner as to deliver broadly consistent prudential outcomes across institutions, bearing in mind that the types of requirements specified may differ between institutions because of their individual circumstances. In addition to the quantity, the structure should specify the expected composition and nature of the requirement. In all cases, it should specify the supervisory requirement and any applicable Directive 2013/36/EU requirements. Liquidity buffers and counterbalancing capacity held by the institution to meet supervisory requirements should be available for use by the institution during times of stress.",
            "529. When setting the specific quantitative liquidity requirements and communicating them to the institution, competent authorities should ensure that they are immediately notified by the institution if it does not meet the requirements, or does not expect to meet the requirements in the short term. Competent authorities should ensure that this notification is submitted without undue delay by the institution, accompanied by a plan drawn up by the institution for the timely restoration of compliance with the requirements. Competent authorities should assess the feasibility of the institution's restoration plan and take appropriate supervisory measures if the plan is not considered feasible. Where the plan is considered feasible, competent authorities should: determine any necessary interim supervisory measures based on the circumstances of the institution; monitor the implementation of the restoration plan; and closely monitor the institution's liquidity position, asking the institution to increase its reporting frequency if necessary.",

Where the institution disregards P2G, does not incorporate it into it risk management framework or does not establish own funds to meet P2G within the time limits set in accordance with paragraph 438, this may lead to competent authorities applying additional supervisory measures as set out in Sections 10.3 and 10.5.

            "615. Competent authorities should, also on the basis of Article 100 of Directive 2013/36/EU, use supervisory stress testing to facilitate the SREP and, in particular, supervisory assessment of its key elements, as described in Title 4 to Title 9. In particular, supervisory stress testing should help competent authorities, where appropriate, with the following: a. The assessment of institutions' individual risks to capital as referred to in Title 6, or risks to liquidity and funding as referred to in Title 8. b. The assessment of the reliability of institutions' stress testing programmes, as well as the relevance, severity and plausibility of scenarios for institutions' own stress tests used for ICAAP and ILAAP purposes. This may include challenging institutions' main assumptions and risk drivers. c. The assessment of institutions' ability to meet TSCR and OCR in the context of the assessment of capital adequacy, as specified in Section 7.7. Depending on the coverage and type of the supervisory stress test, this assessment may be limited only to some elements of TSCR covered by the design features of the supervisory stress testing (e.g. additional own funds requirements for individual risk categories, if the stress test covers only such risk categories). d. The determination of P2G for institutions. e. The identification of possible vulnerabilities or weaknesses in institutions' risk management and controls on individual risk areas. f. The identification of possible deficiencies in overall governance arrangements or institution-wide controls: supervisory stress testing should be considered by competent authorities as an additional source of information for the purposes of the SREP assessment of internal governance and institution-wide controls referred to in Title 5. In particular, if a competent authority identifies by means of supervisory stress testing, deficiencies in the institution's own stress testing programmes or supporting risk data infrastructure, these should be taken into account in the assessment of the overall governance and risk management framework of that institution. g. The determination of specific quantitative liquidity requirements in the context of the assessment of liquidity adequacy, especially where a competent authority has not developed specific supervisory benchmarks for liquidity requirements. Certain 221 elements of the liquidity supervisory stress tests should, where appropriate, be used as inputs when setting specific liquidity requirements for institutions (e.g. a comparative analysis, under adverse scenarios, of net cash outflows and eligible liquid assets over a set of time horizons, assessment of stressed maturity ladder), as specified in Section 9.4.",
            "616. Furthermore, supervisory stress testing should help competent authorities to assess supervisory organisational procedures and to plan supervisory resources, considering also other relevant information, in particular for the more frequent and in-depth assessment of certain SREP elements in the case of non-Category 1 institutions, and for the purposes of determining the scope of the supervisory examination programme required by Article 99 of Directive 2013/36/EU.",
            "617. Competent authorities should also, where appropriate, use the scenarios and outcomes of supervisory stress tests as additional sources of information in the assessment of institutions' recovery plans, in particular when assessing the choice and severity of scenarios and assumptions used by the institution.",
            "618. Competent authorities should also, where appropriate, use supervisory stress testing outcomes to support the analysis needed for the purposes of granting various permissions and authorisations required by Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 or Directive 2013/36/EU, for example in relation to qualifying holdings, mergers and acquisitions, and shares buy-backs.",

            "620. Competent authorities should also, where appropriate, use supervisory stress testing as a way to motivate institutions to enhance their internal stress testing and risk management capabilities: in particular, a supervisory stress test with a bottom-up component could motivate institutions to further develop and improve their data aggregation, risk modelling and IT tools for stress testing and risk management purposes."

Coverage, in terms of covering certain risk factors or multiple risk factors, certain individual portfolios or activities or sectors/geographies, all or several portfolios. b. Design, in terms of the following: (1) sensitivity analysis (single-factor or simple multi-factor), (2) scenario analysis or (3) reverse stress testing. Competent authorities should choose the design that is most appropriate for the objective pursued by the stress test: sensitivity analysis to a single risk factor or multiple risk 222 factors should normally be favoured when assessing individual risk to capital or risks to liquidity or funding; the scenario analysis approach should normally be favoured when an assessment of overall capital adequacy is sought; while reverse stress testing may, inter alia, be deemed appropriate for assessing the severity of the scenarios used by the institution. c. Scope, in terms of covering the perimeter of cross-border groups: for the purposes of the assessment of the overall capital adequacy of the group, competent authorities should ensure that all relevant group entities are taken into account stress tests. d. Sample of institutions covered by the stress tests: when planning supervisory stress testing for more than one institution, competent authorities should consider the appropriate sample for the purposes of the exercise, in particular when using supervisory stress testing for thematic assessments of certain business lines/models or impact studies/assessments. e. Approach (top-down stress test, bottom-up stress test, combination of both, prescribing specific anchor scenarios for institutions).",
            "622. When designing and conducting supervisory stress tests for SREP purposes, competent authorities should consider the outcomes of asset quality reviews (AQR), where available, appropriate and not already incorporated into institutions' financial statements. Combining supervisory stress testing with AQRs can be considered useful in ensuring that the balance- sheet positions of the institutions covered by the supervisory stress tests are reported accurately with improved and comparable starting points across participating institutions.",
            "623. Competent authorities may also consider setting predefined target capital ratios, especially in the context of system-wide stress tests (including country-level stress tests), or setting general or idiosyncratic thresholds. In such cases, these must be suitable and by take into account supervisory objectives. Such targets or thresholds should apply consistently to the institutions within the scope of the supervisory stress tests."

Sufficient human and material resources, data and IT infrastructure to design and conduct supervisory stress tests. In particular, the supervisory stress testing programme should be supported by adequate data and an appropriate methodological approach covering all aspects, including scenarios and assumptions (e.g. templates, guidance, documentation), and ensuring both flexibility and appropriate levels of quality and controls. b. A quality assurance process covering stress testing design, development and execution, and the comparability of results across institutions. c. The integration of supervisory stress testing into other relevant supervisory processes. Hence, when required and subject to any legal constraints, the organisation should support the internal sharing of information and utilisation of all aspects of the stress testing programme (e.g. both quantitative and qualitative results).",

Competent authorities should ensure that they have processes and arrangements in place for an effective dialogue with institutions regarding supervisory stress tests and their outcomes. This dialogue should reflect the intended objectives, be established in particular but not exclusively when supervisory stress tests are run for the purposes of the assessment of the overall capital adequacy of institutions and be organised within the more general context of the SREP assessments as set out in these guidelines. For the purposes of such a dialogue both at the technical and managerial level, where relevant, the competent authorities should ensure that: a. adequate, sufficiently detailed and accurate explanation and guidance is provided to institutions on the application of the methodologies and assumptions used in a bottom-up stress test; b. adequate, sufficiently detailed and accurate instructions are given to institutions with regard to the supporting information required by them to be submitted to competent authorities along with the results of the stress tests; c. explanation is provided to institutions following discussions, where relevant, of the outcomes of supervisory stress tests that lead to the application of supervisory measures. This should be considered by competent authorities in particular in the context of system-wide stress tests that trigger supervisory measures. 224",

Competent authorities should also identify what information regarding supervisory stress tests and their outcomes may be publicly disclosed, taking into account the intended purposes of the supervisory stress tests. When deciding on the public disclosure of the results or methodologies of supervisory stress tests, competent authorities should consider their own role in the exercise and the approach chosen (top-down stress test, bottom-up stress test) and also consider the extent of their own analysis to accompany published results."

When designing methodologies and assumptions for use in supervisory stress tests, competent authorities should decide on the design and features of the exercise that are most suitable for its intended purpose, i.e. that are linked to the supervisory (or other) objectives set by the competent authority. b. When conducting supervisory stress tests on a wider sample of institutions, competent authorities may consider adopting the design of supervisory stress tests for different categories of institutions as set out in Section 2.4, especially if the exercise is top-down. c. Competent authorities should consider the appropriate timelines for conducting supervisory stress tests, including the time horizon of the scenarios and the period over which the management actions proposed by institutions in the stress test exercise are analysed. The timelines for the exercise should also factor in the dialogue with the institution, where relevant for the intended purpose of the exercise and the extent to which the data supplied by the participating institution will remain relevant. d. Competent authorities should consider, where relevant for the intended purpose of the exercise, all known future regulatory changes affecting institutions within the scope and time horizon of the exercise.",
            "631. In the case of a scenario analysis stress test, competent authorities should decide whether to run a single scenario to be applied to all institutions included in the scope of the exercise, or to develop institution-specific scenarios for individual institutions (the latter should not be seen 225 as relieving institutions from the responsibility of designing own scenarios for the purposes of ICAAP and ILAAP stress testing), or a combination of the two. Competent authorities should consider the transferability of capital and liquidity resources in stressed conditions and any possible impediments, including legal and operational impediments, that may exist.",
            "632. Furthermore, the following aspects should be considered when developing the methodologies for supervisory stress tests: a. For the purposes of the assessment of capital adequacy, competent authorities should consider the impact of the stress test on the institution's P&L, balance sheet, risk exposure amount and leverage ratio, and analyse the impact of the stress test on the capital ratios of institutions covered by the exercise. b. For the purposes of bottom-up stress tests, competent authorities should consider the extent to which they prescribe the methodologies for modelling institutions' balance sheets and P&L. Indicatively, institutions' balance sheets may be taken as static, allowing competent authorities to assess current risks over time. Alternatively, they may be allowed to be dynamic, permitting, for example, a more forward-looking exploration of how institutions' business plans might evolve under the stress scenario or how credit volumes might evolve over time. For enhanced comparability, competent authorities may consider opting for the static balance sheet approach. Conversely, for enhanced feedback on institutions' intended or planned reactions vis-a-vis stresses and shocks, the dynamic balance sheet approach may be favoured. c. Competent authorities should consider how to take account of systemic feedback or second-round effects in the stress tests, where relevant, recognising the limitations of providing ex ante assumptions in the case of bottom-up stress tests. d. For the purposes of bottom-up supervisory stress tests, competent authorities should aim to assess the impact of such exercises consistently and fairly across the institutions covered by supervisory stress tests, respecting the level playing field. Competent authorities should also consider the extent to which stress test results reflect differences in modelling choices and judgements among institutions, rather than true differences in the risks to which they are exposed.",
            "633. Competent authorities should aim to assess model risk across stress testing exercises and have access to different types of comparative information. It is recommended to have, where appropriate, several perspectives/benchmarks. It is important to recognise that all models are imperfect and to clearly identify known and potential weaknesses. Understanding these limitations and weaknesses of individual institutions' stress testing models can inform the supervisory stress testing process and mitigate potential problems arising from model risk. 226 Annexes Annex 1. Operational risk, examples of the link between losses and risk drivers To illustrate how operational risk manifests itself, it is necessary to understand the relationship between the drivers of a specific risk event and the impact (i.e. outcome) of the risk event.

            "1. Executive Summary Article 178 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (Capital Requirements Regulation - CRR) specifies the definition of default of an obligor that is used for the purpose of the IRB Approach according to Chapter 3 of Title II in Part Three of the CRR as well as for the Standardised Approach in line with Article 127 of the CRR. In this regard, Article 178(7) of the CRR mandates the EBA to specify guidelines on the application of this Article. Consequently these guidelines specify all aspects related to the application of the definition of default of an obligor. The EBA has identified differing practices used by institutions as regards the definition of default. Consequently these guidelines provide detailed clarification on the application of the definition of default, which includes aspects such as the days past due criterion for default identification, indications of unlikeliness to pay, conditions for a return to non-defaulted status, treatment of the definition of default in external data, application of the default definition in a banking group and specific aspects related to retail exposures. The EBA considers this harmonisation necessary in order to ensure a consistent use of the definition of default and to ensure that a harmonised approach is taken across institutions and jurisdictions. As a result the guidelines will increase comparability of risk estimates and own funds requirements, especially when using IRB models, and will help reduce the burden of compliance for cross-border groups - thus reducing overall RWA variability across institutions. The EBA performed a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the potential impact of these guidelines on institutions' capital requirements. The results indicate that, although the overall level of capital requirements should not change significantly, the dispersion of the impact of some policy proposals across individual institutions is broad and hence some institutions will be more significantly affected than others. It is expected that the implementation of these guidelines may require significant effort and resources of some institutions. In particular, for those institutions that use the IRB Approach and where the default definition will change significantly the implementation of the necessary adjustments may require some time. In order to facilitate the implementation of the changes in the default definition, as a result of either these guidelines or any other changes that may be necessary, these guidelines also consider the implementation process and consequently propose to implement the guidelines only after a phase-in period. Next steps The guidelines will be translated into the official EU languages and published on the EBA website. The deadline for competent authorities to report whether they comply with the guidelines will be two months after the publication of the translations. The guidelines will apply from 1 January 2021, but the EBA encourages institutions to implement the changes prior to this date in order to build the necessary time series. 3 FINAL REPORT ON THE APPLICATION OF THE DEFINITION OF DEFAULT EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY",
            "2. Background and rationale The definition of default was introduced by Directive 2006/48/EC of 14 June 2006 (part of what was known as the Capital Requirements Directive - CRD), later replaced by Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR). The definition of default of an obligor specified in Article 178 of the CRR includes, inter alia, the days past due criterion for default identification, indications of unlikeliness to pay, conditions for a return to non-defaulted status and treatment of the definition of default in external data. However, in the absence of specific rules on these and other aspects of the application of the definition of default various approaches have been adopted across institutions and jurisdictions. As a consequence a wide range of practices has been observed. In order to harmonise the approach the EBA has been mandated in Article 178(7) of the CRR to specify guidelines on the application of this Article. In the majority of jurisdictions specific rules have been adopted concerning the counting of days past due and the application of the materiality threshold. However, the existence of specific rules on other aspects of the definition of default is much less common. In effect, institutions have established their own detailed rules for the identification of default based on their experience and portfolio characteristics, resulting in a substantial variation in these practices across institutions. This is consequently a driver of the variability of risk estimates and capital requirements, and therefore reduces comparability of these measures across institutions. The definition of default influences own funds requirements both under the IRB Approach and under the Standardised Approach. In the case of the IRB Approach it is the basis for estimation of risk parameters and therefore influences risk weights and expected loss calculation for both defaulted and non-defaulted exposures. In the case of the Standardised Approach the definition of default is the basis for the assignment of exposures to the class of exposures in default in line with Article 127 of the CRR. As certain choices in the application of the default definition may have a significant impact on own funds requirements it is important to ensure a level playing field across institutions in the entire EU. Therefore, these guidelines provide detailed guidance on the application of various aspects of the definition of default, including the past due criterion as an indication of default, indications of unlikeliness to pay, specific aspects of the application of the definition of default for retail exposures, application of the default definition in a banking group, treatment of external data and criteria for a return to non-defaulted status. It is expected that the harmonisation of practices will not only increase comparability of risk parameters and own funds requirements but also reduce the burden for cross-border institutions of complying with different requirements in different Member States."

Executive Summary These Guidelines facilitate the consistent approach to the assessment of institutions' internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP) and internal liquidity adequacy assessment process (ILAAP) under the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP) and should be read together with the EBA Guidelines on common procedures and methodologies for SREP1 (SREP Guidelines). In particular, these Guidelines specify what information regarding ICAAP and ILAAP competent authorities should collect from the institutions in order to perform their assessments following the criteria specified in the SREP Guidelines. The information to be collected by the competent authorities based on these Guidelines could be broadly categorised as:",
            "1. ICAAP and ILAAP general information focusing on background information on internal governance, risk management, stress testing frameworks, business model and strategy;",

            "2. Background and rationale",
            "1. Article 73 of Directive 2013/36/EU requires institutions to have in place sound, effective and comprehensive strategies and processes to assess and maintain on an ongoing basis the amounts, types and distribution of internal capital that they consider adequate to cover the nature and level of the risks to which they are or might be exposed (which is commonly referred to internal capital adequacy assessment process - ICAAP). Those strategies and processes shall be subject to regular internal review to ensure that they remain comprehensive and proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of the activities of the institution concerned.",
            "2. Article 86 of Directive 2013/36/EU requires institutions to have robust strategies, policies, processes and systems for the identification, measurement, management and monitoring of liquidity risk over an appropriate set of time horizons and management and monitoring of funding positions, so as to ensure that institutions maintain adequate levels of liquidity buffers and adequate funding (which is commonly referred to as internal liquidity adequacy assessment process - ILAAP). Those strategies, policies, processes and systems shall be tailored to business lines, currencies, branches and legal entities and shall include adequate allocation mechanisms of liquidity costs, benefits and risks. The methodologies for managing and monitoring of funding positions shall include the current and projected material cash-flows in and arising from assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet items, including contingent liabilities and the possible impact of reputational risk.",
            "3. The competent authorities review ICAAP and ILAAP as part of the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP) performed in accordance with Article 97 of Directive 2013/36/EU and in accordance with the EBA Guidelines on common procedures and methodologies for the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP Guidelines)3.",
            "4. Furthermore, the SREP Guidelines provide a set of criteria that competent authorities should consider when assessing ICAAP and ILAAP frameworks and estimates of their internal capital and liquidity calculation. In order to satisfy those assessment criteria the following should be considered: a. ICAAP and ILAAP should be consistent with the risk profile and operating environment of an institution, tailored to the institution's circumstances and needs, and it should use the inputs and definitions that the institution normally uses for internal purposes. At the same time, the institution should make ICAAP and ILAAP understandable to the competent authorities and demonstrate that they are sound, effective and comprehensive. b. The design of ICAAP and ILAAP frameworks is the responsibility of the institutions. ICAAP and ILAAP should be based on adequate measurement and assessment processes including both quantitative and qualitative elements, and they should be 3 EBA/GL/2014/13 of 19 December 2014 5 FINAL REPORT ON DRAFT GUIDELINES ON ICAAP AND ILAAP INFORMATION COLLECTED FOR SREP PURPOSES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY fully documented. ICAAP and ILAAP should form an integral part of institutions' management processes and should be reviewed on a regular basis. ICAAP and ILAAP should be risk based, covering all material risks to which the institution is or might be exposed, and consider also the regulatory, economic or business environment in which the institution operates. c. ICAAP and ILAAP should be forward-looking. Institutions should have an internal strategy for maintaining adequate levels of capital and liquidity taking into account the strategic plans and how they relate to macroeconomic factors. d. ICAAP should produce a reasonable overall capital number and assessment. The institution should be able to explain to the competent authorities the calculation methodologies to make ICAAP understandable and the similarities and differences between its ICAAP and its own funds requirements to enable supervisors to compare the outcomes. e. ILAAP should produce a credible and understandable assessment and outcome. The institution should be able to explain to the competent authorities the methodologies and calculations used and the risks these are looking to address, and a breakdown and summary of the underlying components of the ILAAP calculations.",
            "5. In order to perform supervisory assessments of ICAAP and ILAAP frameworks, and determine whether institutions' ICAAP and ILAAP meet the criteria specified in the SREP Guidelines and above, competent authorities should have access to various ICAAP- and ILAAP-specific and background information, including institutions' policies and methodological documents, operational documents and supporting documents evidencing the use of ICAAP and ILAAP in the risk management and strategic management of an institution.",
            "6. The aim of these Guidelines is to ensure convergence of supervisory practices in the assessment of ICAAP and ILAAP as required by the SREP Guidelines by introducing a common set of information that competent authorities will be using in their assessments.",
            "7. In particular, the Guidelines specify what information, regarding ICAAP and ILAAP, competent authorities should collect from the institutions in order to perform their assessments: a. an overarching document ('reader's manual') that facilitates the assessment of ICAAP and ILAAP documents and provides an extended index of the documents and their status, an overview of where the information items specified in these Guideline can be found in the documentation provided by an institution and other information relevant for the competent authority at the start of the assessment; b. general information about ICAAP and ILAAP frameworks, business model and strategy, as well as governance arrangements, and stress testing programmes as specified in Section 5 of these Guidelines; c. ICAAP-specific information as specified in Section 6 of these Guidelines; d. ILAAP-specific information as specified in Section 7 of these Guidelines; and 6 FINAL REPORT ON DRAFT GUIDELINES ON ICAAP AND ILAAP INFORMATION COLLECTED FOR SREP PURPOSES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY e. summary of main conclusions from ICAAP and ILAAP and quality assurance information as specified in Section 8 of these Guidelines.",
            "8. In addition to specifying information items, these Guidelines also set general criteria for competent authorities to organise collection of ICAAP and ILAAP information from institutions and using such information for the purposes of their assessments of other SREP elements. When specifying such criteria, these Guidelines recognise the principle of proportionality in relation to the frequency, granularity, reference dates and remittance dates for ICAAP and ILAAP information that should be determined in relation to the SREP categorisation of institutions, minimum supervisory engagement model and supervisory examination programmes.",
            "9. In particular, the competent authorities would be expected to receive from Category 1 institutions all information specified in these Guidelines annually by a single set date (which might differ between the specific institutions to reflect the organisation and planning of the SREP process) as a comprehensive package. The scope, format, frequencies, remittance dates and reference dates for the information submissions for non-Category 1 institutions may be different and will be determined by the competent authorities for each category of institutions, or individual institutions, where appropriate, depending on the respective minimum supervisory engagement model and supervisory examination programmes, where appropriate coordinating these arrangements within the colleges of supervisors.",
            "10.As provided in the SREP Guidelines, the categorisation of institutions drives the level of the minimum supervisory engagement with an institution, but will also define supervisory expectations of the standards the institution is expected to meet. As a consequence, the SREP categorisation defines the supervisory expectation about the set-up and sophistication of ILAAP and ICAAP including the relevance of some of the information items included in these Guidelines.",
            "11.Furthermore, proportionality applies also regarding the actual content of the information provided by institutions, and in particular in relation to the depth, detail and scope of the ICAAP and ILAAP documentation. Since in principle all information items specified in these Guidelines could be relevant for both complex and less complex institutions, and taking into account that these Guidelines does not specify the level of detail in which the information items should be covered, no split in information items was made in the Guidelines in relation to proportionality.",
            "12. Thus, by means of these Guidelines the EBA does not aim to introduce any specific ICAAP/ILAAP 'report', but identifies information items and their core content, recognising that such information can be provided either through a single report, specifically prepared by an institution for the purposes of ICAAP/ILAAP submissions, or as separate documents that are already available in the bank. The specific form of the submission of information will be determined by the competent authorities when applying these Guidelines.",
            "13. The Guidelines also do not introduce any specific common templates for quantitative data to support ICAAP and ILAAP assessments, nor do they introduce common risk taxonomy, assessment criteria or methodological considerations other than already specified in the SREP Guidelines. 7 FINAL REPORT ON DRAFT GUIDELINES ON ICAAP AND ILAAP INFORMATION COLLECTED FOR SREP PURPOSES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY",

            "1. Trust in the reliability of the financial system is crucial for its proper functioning and a prerequisite if it is to contribute to the economy as a whole. Consequently, effective internal governance arrangements are fundamental if institutions, individually and the banking system they form, are to operate well.",
            "2. In recent years, internal governance issues have received increased attention from various international bodies. Their main aim has been to correct institutions' weak or superficial internal governance practices, as identified during the financial crisis. These faulty practices, while not a direct trigger for the financial crisis, were closely associated with it and were questionable. In addition, recently, there has been a greater focus on conduct-related shortcomings and activities in offshore financial centres.",
            "3. In some cases, at the time of the financial crisis the absence of effective checks and balances within institutions resulted in a lack of effective oversight of management decision-making, which led to short-term oriented and excessively risky management strategies. Weak oversight by the management body in its supervisory function has been identified as a contributing factor. The management body, both in its management function and, in particular, in its supervisory function, might not have understood the complexity of the business and the risks involved, consequently failing to identify and constrain excessive risk- taking in an effective manner.",
            "4. Internal governance frameworks, including internal control mechanisms and risk management, were often not sufficiently integrated within institutions or groups. There was a lack of a uniform methodology and terminology, so that a holistic view of all risks did not exist. Internal control functions often lacked appropriate resources, status and/or expertise.",
            "5. Conversely, sound internal governance practices helped some institutions to manage the financial crisis significantly better than others. These practices included the setting of an appropriate risk strategy and appropriate risk appetite levels, a holistic risk management framework and effective reporting lines to the management body.",
            "6. Against this background, there is a clear need to address the potentially detrimental effects of poorly designed internal governance arrangements on the sound management of risk, to ensure effective oversight by the management body, in particular in its supervisory function, to promote a sound risk culture at all levels of institutions and to enable competent authorities to supervise and monitor the adequacy of internal governance arrangements. 5 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Legal basis",

The members of the management body of a consolidating institution should keep themselves informed about the risks the group's structure causes, taking into account the criteria specified in Section 7 of the guidelines. This includes receiving: a. information on major risk drivers; b. regular reports assessing the institution's overall structure and evaluating the compliance of individual entities' activities with the approved group-wide strategy; and c. regular reports on topics where the regulatory framework requires compliance at individual, sub-consolidated and consolidated levels. 31 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY"

Institutions should take into account in their decision-making the results of a risk assessment performed to identify whether such structures could be used for a purpose connected with money laundering, terrorist financing or other financial crimes and the respective controls and legal framework in place29. To this end, institutions should take into account at least: a. the extent to which the jurisdiction in which the structure will be set up complies effectively with EU and international standards on tax transparency, anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism30; b. the extent to which the structure serves an obvious economic and lawful purpose; c. the extent to which the structure could be used to hide the identity of the ultimate beneficial owner; d. the extent to which the customer's request that leads to the possible setting up of a structure gives rise to concern; e. whether the structure might impede appropriate oversight by the institution's management body or the institution's ability to manage the related risk; and f. whether the structure poses obstacles to effective supervision by competent authorities.",
            "77. In any case, institutions should not set up opaque or unnecessarily complex structures which have no clear economic rationale or legal purpose or structures that could raise concerns that these might be created for a purpose connected with financial crime.",

When setting up such structures, the management body should understand them and their purpose and the particular risks associated with them and ensure that the internal control functions are appropriately involved. Such structures should be approved and maintained only when their purpose has been clearly defined and understood, and whenthe management body is satisfied that all material risks, including reputational risks, have been identified, that all risks can be managed effectively and appropriately reported, and that effective oversight has been ensured. The more complex and opaque the organisational and operational structure, and the greater the risks, the more intensive the oversight of the structure should be."

The methodologies should allow for the aggregation of risk exposures across business lines and support the identification of risk concentrations. The tools should include the assessment of the actual risk profile against the institution's risk appetite, as well as the identification and assessment of potential and stressed risk exposures under a range of assumed adverse circumstances against the institution's risk capacity. The tools should provide information on 48 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY any adjustment to the risk profile that may be required. Institutions should make appropriately conservative assumptions when building stressed scenarios.",
            "157. Institutions should take into consideration that the results of quantitative assessment methodologies, including stress testing, are highly dependent on the limitations and assumptions of the models (including the severity and duration of the shock and the underlying risks). For example, models showing very high returns on economic capital may result from a weakness in the models (e.g. the exclusion of some relevant risks) rather than a superior strategy or excellent execution of a strategy on the part of the institution. The determination of the level of risk taken should not therefore be based only on quantitative information or model outputs; it should also comprise a qualitative approach (including expert judgement and critical analysis). Relevant macroeconomic environmental trends and data should be explicitly addressed to identify their potential impact on exposures and portfolios.",

The ultimate responsibility for risk assessment lies solely with the institution, which, accordingly, should evaluate its risks critically and should not rely exclusively on external assessments. For example, an institution should validate a purchased risk model and calibrate it to its own individual circumstances to ensure that the model accurately and comprehensively captures and analyses the risk.",

Regular and transparent reporting mechanisms should be established so that the management body, its risk committee, where established, and all relevant units in an institution are provided with reports in a timely, accurate, concise, understandable and meaningful manner and can share relevant information about the identification, measurement or assessment, monitoring and management of risks. The reporting framework should be well defined and documented.",

Effective communication and awareness regarding risks and the risk strategy is crucial for the whole risk management process, including the review and decision -making processes, and helps prevent decisions that may unknowingly increase risk.

            "3. The amendments to the guidelines should ensure that institutions have specific governance arrangements regarding the management of money laundering and terrorist financing risks and to avoid that they contribute to dividend arbitrage schemes. Institutions should also have a strong framework to manage conflicts of interests and ensure prudent decision-making in the context of loans to related parties. B. Baseline scenario",
            "4. The current EU legislative framework for institutions' internal governance consists mainly of Directive 2013/36/EU, the EBA guidelines on internal governance, the EBA Guidelines on the assessment of the suitability of members of the management body and key function holders and the EBA Guidelines on outsourcing.",

Guidelines have been provided on the code of conduct that link the guidelines to the requirements on non-discrimination and equal opportunities within the European Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Those additions have no impact as the underlying provisions are fundamental principles that are already 64 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY implemented by Member States based on the aforementioned frameworks. The EBA has to take those frameworks into account when setting out guidelines.",
            "7. The guidelines provide additional clarity about the institutions internal governance in the context of AML/CTF provisions. Institutions should already have sufficient governance arrangements in place to ensure that they comply with Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorist Financing and tax laws. The related risks are already covered by the CRD requirement on institutions to manage all their risks. Hence, the clarifications provided in the guidelines should not trigger any implementation costs if the institution concerned already had the required arrangements in place and had implemented the requirements under Directive (EU) 2015/849 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015.",
            "8. In addition the guidelines have been clarified regarding the management of conflicts of interest in relation to loans and other transactions to members of the management body and their related parties. Given that specific provisions have been added to Directive 2013/36/EU it was considered necessary to clarify the regulatory expectations and the requirements with regard to the documentation of such loans and the management of related conflicts of interest. It is necessary that institutions document all loans and transactions. The specific documentation elements on such loans in the guidelines are limited and do not create a material burden. The need to identify such loans, to document them and to comply with the GDPR in this context is created by the requirement within the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD). Hence, the costs for those aspects are not assessed as part of this impact assessment.",
            "9. The objective of the changes are that there is sufficient scrutiny on decisions regarding such loans and that conflicts of interest in that context are appropriately managed. Restricting the guidelines to loans to members of the management body and their related parties would not be effective as other transactions might also create material conflicts of interests. Limited additional documentation elements regarding the conditions of such loans as compared to market conditions and their volumes are necessary to assess the appropriateness of the management of conflicts of interests. Given the need to document contractual conditions and to comply e.g. with the large loan regime it is assessed that the additional costs for providing the additional information, when requested, is low.",

Given the limited amendments to the guidelines and given that they are based on amendments of Directive 2013/36/EU and other existing legal requirements, it is assumed that changes to the guidelines create no or very low implementation costs for updates to internal policies and additional documentation. 65 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY",
            "5.2. Summary of responses to the consultation and the EBA's analysis The EBA published its consultation paper on 31 July 2020 and received overall 18 responses; 16 of them were published, while the other 2 have been submitted on a confidential basis. The consultation was limited to the changes made to the guidelines previously in place. Therefore, comments received on guidelines that have not been amended are in general not included in the feedback table. The Banking Stakeholder Group did not submit an opinion. The main comments received challenged the chapter on related party transactions and the manner in which the topic of anti-money laundering has been integrated into the guidelines. Many respondents challenged the legal basis to ask institutions for specific actions regarding third party transactions, while the CRD includes only specific documentation requirements on loans to members of the management body and their related parties. The submission of information on loans to members of the management body and their related parties is set out in Article 88 of the CRD, and the management of conflicts of interests is also explicitly required under Article 88 of the CRD. Decisions on related party loans and transactions should be made objectively and related conflicts of interests must be identified and managed. The guidelines have been aligned with the CRD requirements and specify them further. The guidelines further specify how conflicts of interest in this context should be managed and which information on such loans should be made available to competent authorities upon request. Many institutions had objections to the provision that a member of the management body should be identified as being responsible for implementation of the requirements in Directive 2018/843 (AMLDV) on anti-money laundering and terrorist financing. Moreover, some respondents would preferto remove the guidance provided in light of other upcoming EBA work on this topic. The guidelines have been aligned with the requirements under AMLDV, which is in the scope of the EBA's action. Institutions' governance arrangements must take into account the risks that can emerge from being involved or being exploited in the context of money laundering and terrorist financing. The management body bears the overall responsibility for implementing the related policies and processes. However, many national laws, in line with the AMLDV, indeed foresee that companies that are subject to the AMLDV must identify one member of the management body, where such a body exists, as being responsible. The EBA is working on additional guidelines on AML compliance, while the guidelines on internal governance set out high level principles on AML compliance and principles on the management of risks triggered by ML/TF risk factors. The AML/CTF framework is part of institutions governance arrangements and therefore the topic has been retained within the guidelines. Other comments received concern the principles included regarding non-discrimination and equal opportunities and respondents found that those guidelines would exceed the EBA's mandate. 66 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY All institutions are not only subject to the CRD and CRR requirements, but also to other laws and regulations. The code of conduct and working conditions are part of institutions' governance arrangements. When setting out guidelines under the mandates received under the CRD, the EBA also has to take into account the values of the European Union and other directives and regulations in place, including the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the European Charter of Fundamental Rights and the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 July 2006 on the implementation of the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation. A detailed analysis of the comments received is included in the feedback table below. 67 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE Summary of responses to the consultation and the EBA's analysis EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA analysis Amendments to the proposals General comments Date of application Several respondents suggest postponing the date of application to duly take into account the time needed for the CRD and Investment Firm Directive (IFD) national transposition processes, translations of the guidelines (GL) into the EU languages and the 'comply and explain' procedures. The EBA appreciates that the implementation of the revised guidelines will require some time and has postponed the date of application. However, the guidelines (GL) do not change the timelines for the implementation of national laws that will have entered into force. GL amended Definitions Some respondents recommend ensuring alignment to the definitions provided in the EBA GL on fitness and propriety. More specifically, reference is made to the definitions of 'prudential consolidation' and 'relevant institution'. The EBA has reviewed the mentioned guidelines and ensured that definitions are consistent. However, smaller differentiations were necessary, given their different scope of application, e.g. the term 'relevant institution' also includes Class 2 investment firms, while the present GL do not apply to such investment firms. The definition of 'prudential consolidation' has been added for the sake of completeness, while it is, in principle, not necessary as the method to be used and its scope is set out in Regulation (EU) 575/2013. GL amended Scope of application Some respondents ask for further clarifications regarding the scope of application, especially related to the prudential consolidation, materiality of risks and other transactions. All institutions that are subject to Directive 2013/36/EU (CRD) are within the scope of application of the guidelines. The requirements on governance under the CRD apply on an individual and consolidated basis, unless the waivers in Article 21 of the CRD are applied. All institutions are subject to the provisions on related party loans in the CRD and the requirement to manage conflicts of interests (COI). The GL set out further details on how institutions should manage such COI also in the context of other transactions. No change 68 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA analysis Amendments to the proposals The scope of application is not affected by the materiality of risks. The materiality of risks and the needed risk management measures depend on the business model of the institution, its risk appetite, risk bearing capacity and all relevant risk factors. Application of national and sector-specific law On several occasions respondents asked to add references to relevant national or sector-specific requirements that apply to subsidiaries. The GL aim to achieve harmonisation on an EU level. All institutions and all their subsidiaries have to comply with all applicable Union and national legal requirements without this fact being stated in guidelines. A sentence has been added to the background section. Background amended Definitions A few respondents suggest adding a definition on 'Management Body' and 'Senior Management' (to the guidelines. The named definitions are provided within the CRR and the CRD. No change Anti-discrimination policies Some respondents complain about the lack of legal basis for the introduction of the requirement to adopt these policies, both in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and in banking supervision law (CRD V). Anti-discrimination rules are a part of robust governance arrangements, The guidelines determine how compliance should be achieved. The legal mandate is provided in Article 74 CRD and Art. 16 of the EBA founding regulation. When providing guidelines, the EBA also has to take into account the Treaty, European Charter of Fundamental Rights and other EU Directives and Regulations. No change Anti-discrimination policies Considering that some national legal frameworks already provide requirements on the adoption of non- discrimination policies, some respondents suggest adopting a more proportional approach to ensure non- discrimination and consider the policies that are already in place to suffice for complying with the GL. Where policies are in place that ensure compliance with the GL, it is not necessary to create new policies. It is important that institutions take appropriate measures to ensure that there is no discrimination. Such measures need to be documented. GL amended Anti-discrimination policies With specific regard to gender-neutral policies, some respondents seek guidance on their application in smaller banks and/or in dual board structures. In small banks adopting a dual board governance structure, the While institutions need to take into account the gender balance when recruiting new members of the management body, there is no guideline included that requires a certain minimum representation. Having a gender-neutral remuneration policy does No change 69 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA analysis Amendments to the proposals management body often consists of only two members, who usually hold this position for a longer period of time. For them, a gender-balanced composition would mean that one board member should always be a woman. not require having male and female members of the management body in its management function. The composition of the management body should be subject to a diversity policy. With small management boards, a more diverse approach could also be achieved by having a more gender-balanced supervisory function. ML/FT risks in the internal control and general risk management framework Several respondents suggest clarifying if the GL aim to integrate the AML/CTF check in the general risk management. If so, clarifications are also needed on the effects on the responsibilities within the credit institutions. For some respondents, AML should not be arbitrarily dropped into the 'overarching internal controls' section. It should instead be included within its own sub-heading as a sub-topic. A few respondents commented that the results of the AML/CTF check should not have any impact on regulatory requirements, especially not on capital requirements; a negative result of the AML/CTF check can only result in the rejection or increased monitoring of the business relationship. Many respondents recommend more proportionality on the requirement to adopt specific risk mitigation measures: they evidence that, with regard to operational and reputational risks arising from ML/TF risks, such measures are not necessary for all institutions, depending largely on the nature and complexity of individual business activities. The GL have been clarified. Institutions need to take into account money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risk factors in their general risk management. However, they also need to ensure compliance with the provisions under Directive (EU) 2015/849 (AMLD), including that they implement appropriate AML/CTF controls. While both issues are related, their context (prudential/compliance) differs. While the AMLD requires specific measures, the present guidelines deal with the internal governance of institutions and its risk management in more general. Hence, singling out AML provisions, rather than integrating such requirements in the control framework, has not been seen as appropriate. Moreover, the EBA is going to issue additional guidelines in the area of AML/CTF compliance. In any case, institutions need to be aware that AML/CTF breaches can also lead to operational and reputational risks and, if systematic, doubts regarding the suitability of members of the management body. The present guidelines do not contain provisions that are related to potential capital add-ons. It is self-evident that the needed controls and risk mitigation measures should take into account the existing risk factors and risk levels. GL amended 70 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA analysis Amendments to the proposals ESG factors in the risk management framework Generally, respondents do not find the proposal clear and recommend either providing further clarification or deleting. The GL cannot replace the major work that is on its way in the area of ESG risk factors. It is important that institutions take into account ESG risk factors and adjust their business model and risk appetite where necessary. The GL were clarified to ensure that the responsibility of the management body to ensure an appropriate management of all risks, including risks driven by ESG risk factors, are managed. GL amended Responses to questions in Consultation Paper EBA/CP/2020/20 Comments to the background section Para. 14 Background and rationale Some respondents comment that the reference to 'offshore financial centres' is not clearly defined. Therefore, the GL should use a consistent and more legally clear term such as 'third country', unless a distinction is established between third countries and offshore financial centres. The GL reflect the wording within the CRD. Indeed, the application of the CRD requirements outside the EU on a consolidated basis is not different between 'third countries' and 'offshore financial centres'. While international bodies, e.g. the IMF provide for a definition of 'offshore financial centres', the CRD does not. It has been clarified that there is no differentiation of the CRD requirements between third countries and offshore financial centres. GL amended Para. 14-15 Background and rationale One respondent comment that the principle of proportionality should also apply when applying the guidelines on the consolidated basis. Therefore, Paragraph 14 should specify as follows: 'Under Article 109(2) of Directive 2013/13/EU, these guidelines apply on a sub-consolidated and consolidated basis by taking into account the proportionality principle.' Some respondents comment that 'adequate', added in Paragraph 14 of the Legal Basis, is not in line with The principle of proportionality is a general principle of law that also applies to the EBA Guidelines. It entails, that all provisions are applied in a proportionate way. It does not mean that certain provisions may not be applied. The wording of Paragraph 14 has been aligned with the CRD text. GL amended 71 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA analysis Amendments to the proposals Article 109 CRD V. One respondent suggests that 'sound', 'solid' or 'similar' may be better suited in the relevant context. Para. 19 Background and rationale One respondent suggests limiting the reference to the EBA publication by type, as otherwise it would be too broad. The comment has been accommodated. Background amended Para. 21 Background and rationale A few respondents ask for clarification to which 'bodies' the guidelines refer. The background section has been clarified. GL amended Para. 31 Background and rationale One respondent asks whether the renaming to 'three lines model' by the Institute of Internal Auditors has a bearing on these guidelines and the name of the 'three lines of defence' model. The IIA's model allows the 1st and 2nd line to be blended. This is quite a substantial difference compared to these guidelines which clearly require the independence of the control functions in credit institutions. The respondent requests how the EBA will take the IIA's three lines model into consideration. Within institutions, the internal control functions must be independent of the business they control in line with the CRD and also international standards (e.g. BCBS). There is no intention to deviate from this approach. No change Para. 33 Background and rationale One respondent asks for revision of the background section as regards the compliance function's scope of responsibility is defined too broad and prescriptive. Even though the compliance function is considered to be a crucial function for ensuring compliance with laws and regulations, it should not be responsible for compliance with all applicable laws and regulations but rather with those related to the Compliance function as such. The background section is clear and provides an overview on the internal organisation of the institution. The guidelines further specify the CRD requirements. It is deemed sufficiently clear, that the compliance function does not carry all those responsibilities all on its own, but together with the first line of defence and other functions (e.g. legal unit) within the institution. No change 72 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA analysis Amendments to the proposals Para. 40 Background and rationale Some respondents suggest that this section should only refer to loans and not to other transactions (CRD V\nconsiders loans only). See comments above under general comments. No change Comments to the guidelines Para. 14 Definitions One respondent recommends to review the definitions and operate with one set of definitions for the guidelines on internal governance and the guidelines on fitness and propriety (e.g. definition of staff, prudential consolidation). The term 'relevant institutions' has been introduced in the guidelines on fitness and propriety and makes it difficult to further differentiate between the categories of institutions that are now in scope (there are overall 6 categories: 'institutions', 'CRD-institutions', 'relevant institutions', 'significant CRD-institutions', 'listed relevant institutions and listed institutions', 'consolidating credit institutions'); on the other side, the Internal Governance GL operates with the terms 'significant credit institutions' and 'listed CRD credit institutions'. The definitions within the guidelines have been reviewed and aligned to the extent possible. As the scope of application of the guidelines differs, it is necessary to include additional definitions within the guidelines on fitness and propriety. E.g. the term 'relevant institution' comprises institutions subject to the CRD and investment firms, unless they are small and not interconnected. GL amended Para. 7 Scope of application One respondent suggests that the EBA considers how to extend the scope to all financial services firms (e.g. payment providers). The EBA's mandate is to provide guidance on the application of requirements set out in directives and regulations within its scope of action. The EBA does not have the power to extent the scope of application of the CRD to other financial institutions. No change Para. 7 Scope of application A few respondents asks for confirmation that the deletion of the definition 'institution' and the use of the word 'credit institution' is linked to the new IFR/IFD regulation and to the new definition of credit institutions. This was indeed the intention. Some investment firms will have to apply for an authorisation under the CRD. The CRD continues to use the term 'institutions' for all entities that are subject to the CRD. The EBA will amend the guidelines accordingly. However, some GL amended 73 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA analysis Amendments to the proposals investment firms are required via the IFD to apply the provisions of Title VII of the CRD, this has been clarified in the guidelines. Para. 15 Date of application Several respondents suggest postponing the date of application, taking into consideration the Covid-19 pandemic and the implementation date of the whistleblower directive (17 December 2021) and that IT system changes are needed to comply with the requirements on related party loans and transactions. One respondent 'points out that for investment firms that are subject to the guidelines, it might be difficult to comply with the new guidelines in a short period of time especially in Member States where the local regulations on corporate governance did not apply to them. The effective coming into force of the amendments within the guidelines has been set to 31.12.2021, take into account the time needed for their implementation. Investment firms that will have to apply for authorisation as credit institution were subject to the previous EBA guidelines on internal governance, that are now being updated. Investment firms, unless small and not interconnected, are subject to the IFD and apply the governance requirements as further specified within the corresponding EBA guidelines under IFD. Small and non-interconnected investment firms continue to apply the governance requirements under Directive 2014/65/EU (MiFID) and the Commissions Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/584 on organisational requirements. GL amended No change Para. 17 Proportionality One respondent raises that the section on the proportionality principles differ between the two guidelines. The scope of application and subject matter of the guidelines on internal governance and the guidelines on fitness and propriety differ. Different factors to determine the proportionate application of the provisions have therefore a different relevance, while the general principle is indeed the same. Some criteria have, however, been aligned. GL amended Para. 19 and 84 Proportionality and organisational framework in a group context One respondent suggested a specific proportionality regime for subsidiaries that are set up to develop and accelerate technology and innovation businesses (e.g. proprietary software and technology infrastructure, payment services) to serve the Group's banks at arms- length and suggest that those subsidiaries should not be The CRD applies also on a consolidated basis. The scope of prudential consolidation is specified within the CRR. The principle of proportionality determines how requirements and provisions within these guidelines are applied in a proportionate way. Creating additional waivers within guidelines for certain firms in the scope of No change 74 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA analysis Amendments to the proposals subject to the banks' governance requirements on a consolidated basis. prudential consolidation is not possible under the existing legal framework. Para. 19(m) Proportionality Regarding the introduction of small and non-complex institutions, some respondents recommended adding a reference to the relevant CRR 2 provisions. The comment has been accommodated. GL amended Para. 19(m) Proportionality Some respondents asked to clarify that the proportionality criteria could be considered even though the entity is classified as a large institution. All criteria are applied in parallel and do not limit the consideration of other criteria. The guidelines do not contain any limits to the proportionality principle, but the CRD contains specific provisions with which large institutions must comply. In some cases, the CRD also established minimum requirements for all institutions. The principle of proportionality also requires the largest and most complex institutions to comply with the requirements in a more sophisticated manner than is expected from average or small institutions. No change Para. 21 and 22 Role and responsibility of the management body Some respondents proposed to (re)move the last sentence of Paragraph 22 to Paragraph 21 since it would not only refer to the management board in its supervisory function. The wording has been clarified. GL amended Question 2 Setting up of an AML/TF control framework Para. 23 and 32 Some respondents asked for clarification regarding the upcoming EBA products in this area and suggested to wait concerning the inclusion of AML in the guidelines until other work on this topic has been completed and recommend adding cross references. Several respondents proposed the removal of all references to the identification of a member of the management board as responsible for ensuring compliance with the national implementation of AMLD on the grounds of contradiction with certain national The guidelines clarify that ML/TF risk factors are one of the factors that are relevant for the institution's risk. Moreover, the guidelines determine that a control function should be responsible for monitoring AML/CTF compliance as part of the robust governance arrangements. The EBA's work on AML/CTF is part of the overall working program, available at: https://www.eba.europa.eu/about-us/work- programme/current-work-programme GL amended 75 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA analysis Amendments to the proposals corporate laws that, for instance, apply the principles of collegiality and joint and several responsibility to the management body (e.g., in one-tier board systems). They also highlight that Article 46(4) AMLD, when setting 'where applicable', leaves room for Member States to stipulate otherwise, the topic still not being sufficiently harmonised. In one-tier systems it could entail assigning that responsibility to an executive director (e.g., the CEO, who is in many instances the sole executive member within the board 'effectively directing the institution'), and that would put into question the independence and accountability framework from internal control functions envisaged in the guidelines on internal governance. It would also be impossible in a hybrid system where there is a CEO who can be (but is not systemically) part of the board of directors. Respondents find it is hard to see the rationale behind a new accountability regime, applicable only to AML/CTF issues, where responsibility would lie with a member of the management body instead of with the corresponding internal control head (accountable directly to the management body as a whole). A few respondents suggest merging Para. 23(c) and (d) to avoid creating two parallel control frameworks. Given the upcoming additional work, the guidelines have been revised to only include high-level principles re the AML/CTF compliance officer and compliance function and related responsibilities at the level of the management body. Where the head of a control function is a member of the management body, institutions should be mindful of any possible conflicts of interests. The same applies when assigning responsibilities regarding the AML/CTF function. The allocation of such responsibilities to a member of the management body does not reduce the overall responsibility of the management body for this topic as prescribed in Art. 88 CRD. Para. 23 and 32 Proportionality and role and responsibility of the management body Reporting lines Some respondents also find that assigning the responsibility to a member of the management body contradicts Para. 155-156, which determine that the heads of internal control functions should be directly accountable to the management body and 'be able to have access and report directly to the management body in its supervisory Also internal control functions could be headed by a member of the management body. The approach regarding AML compliance is consistent with the approach for other control functions. All institutions have to have a management function and a supervisory function within the management body. The governance arrangements must be in line with this approach, hence, reporting No change 76 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA analysis Amendments to the proposals function to raise concerns and warn the supervisory function, where appropriate, when specific developments affect or may affect the credit institution'. lines to the supervisory function can always be established, even if a control function is led by a member of the management body in its management function. According to the CRD all persons who direct the business (including the CEO) are per definition part of the management body and the respective CRD requirements. Respondents point to difficulties to implement such requirements in unitary board structures and find it impossible in hybrid system, where there is a CEO who can be (but is not systemically) part of the board of directors. Para. 23 Cross references One respondent points to the changed references (due to the new structure of the draft guidelines) in points k (Section 8 instead of 9), l (Section 9 instead of 10) and m (Section 10 instead of 11) of Paragraph 23. All cross references in the document have been reviewed and where necessary corrected. GL amended Question 3 Para. 24 role and responsibility of the management body Some respondents find that the guidelines are not sufficiently clear and should either be expended or the paragraphs should be removed as the responsibilities are already covered in Para. 23. A few responses add that ESG risks are not a separate risk category. It is suggested to delete the last part of Para. 24 'that takes into account all risks, including environmental, social and governance risks'. One respondent asked for a further explanation on the definition of a sustainable business model. One respondent asks for clarification why the guidelines add a section on ESG and at the same time mention that the EBA is developing a separate work on ESG. It is important to introduce a reference to ESG risk factors and for other risk management purposes and to the responsibility on institutions to take into account such factors and their impact on relevant risk exposures created by the transition of the economy and the risk of external events that could lead to losses, e.g. due to climate change or natural disasters. Such risks need to be taken into account in the institutions business model. Some additional clarity has been provided in a principled manner to not pre-empt upcoming work at European level and at the EBA. GL amended Question 4 ESG risks Another respondent evidences that there is currently no uniform definition of ESG risks and therefore suggests replacing 'environmental, social and governance risks' by 'environmental, social and governance factors'. The wording has been reviewed and reference is made to ESG risk factors. GL amended 77 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA analysis Amendments to the proposals Para. 34 Formal independence One respondent again questions the requirement of formal independence. It would have no Level 1 basis, and would be very difficult to comply with due to the governance structure of cooperative banks, as management board members are, by nature and statutory, or imposed by law, clients and shareholders. It would also be incompatible with the fit and proper requirements such as experience, especially to chair a committee. This paragraph has not been consulted on, please refer to the feedback provided to the previous version of these guidelines. No change Para. 43: setting up committees AML – committee One respondent asks for more guidance on the suggestion to establish a committee, e.g. AML/CTF. Indications would be useful as to the size at which it would make sense to establish such a committee. The establishment of such a committee is a possibility for institutions to ensure robust governance arrangements, but not a general regulatory requirement. While some institutions may deal with this topic in the risk committee, others may prefer to establish a separate committee. No change Para. 61 Committee's process One respondent asks to clarify that the factors listed (including the new reference to AML/CFT compliance) should be read as each applicable to one or both (but not necessarily both) committees (risk and nomination committee). Since AML/CTF information can be strictly confidential (especially suspicious activity reports (SARs)) one respondent recommends deleting the wording 'including AML/CTF compliance' in order to avoid conflicting regulatory requirements. At least, if the proposal is not accepted, it is suggested to add the exclusion of SARs from the information access of the committees. The guidelines apply to both committees when they are established. The committees need to receive information that is relevant for their work. As part of this they also need to receive some aggregated information on the frequency of SARs (risk committee). The guidelines have been clarified that no individual SARs should be submitted. GL amended Question 4 Para. 84 A few respondents request adding a definition of 'offshore financial centres' and to clarify if this notion leads to The wording 'offshore financial centres' repeats the wording used in Article 109 of the CRD. The use of this term in the guidelines does No change not lead to a differentiation of the CRD requirements between such 78 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA analysis Amendments to the proposals Organisational framework in a group context different requirements regarding the expected governance arrangements. centres and other third countries and therefore no definition is necessary. Question 4 Para. 84 One respondent asks why 'on a consolidated and sub- consolidated basis' is mentioned whereas Article 109(2) CRD IV mentions 'on a consolidated or sub-consolidated basis'. The comment has been accommodated. GL amended (former) Section 8: Outsourcing Policy Some respondents noted that the removal of the (former) Section 8 would require additional cross-checking since the guidelines on outsourcing arrangements make several references to these guidelines. A section on outsourcing policies has been added to the guidelines. GL amended Para. 92: risk culture Some respondents state that the 'righteous culture' is not sufficiently clearly defined. One respondent added that it would include judgmental elements that might not fit to a culture, but rather to preventive and corrective structures and processes. The guidelines have been clarified, the intention is to ensure that the risk culture is not only lawful and consistent with the institutions' risk appetite, but also in line with the values that are expected to be met by a diligent bank, e.g. in the context of implementing and applying the AML/CTF framework. GL amended Question 5 Para. 98 and 99: general comment Some respondents recommend these paragraphs be deleted for lack of a legal basis and argue that these paragraphs are outside the scope of the CRD, which only requires a gender-neutral remuneration policy and does not include additional requirements for other areas within the institution in the field of anti-discrimination or equal opportunities. Moreover, several dispositions of regional, national and EU law (e.g., European Charter) already provide for obligations to establish no-discrimination policies and in particular anti-gender discrimination policies. Article 74 CRD requires that institutions have robust governance arrangements. It is part of the EBA's role to take into account such principles when setting out guidelines. Robust governance arrangements should ensure that the principles set regarding non- discrimination and equal opportunities in the TFEU, European convention on human rights and the European Charter of fundamental rights (e.g. Article 21 and 23) are met. Member States should have implemented such requirements in line with Directive 2006/54/EC on equal opportunities. Institutions should ensure compliance with such principles. Where institutions already have policies in place under national law, that GL amended 79 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA analysis Amendments to the proposals A few other respondents support the approach or even ask that further details be provided and ask to fully align the principle with the text of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights (e.g. re the terms birth and origin). are in line with the EBA's Guidelines, no further implementation burden would exist. It is not necessary to have one single document containing all the measures taken, but institutions must be able to demonstrate that they have ensured that there is no discrimination in the meaning of the guidelines. Institutions should actively aim at increasing the pool of suitable candidates for positions within the management body. By improving the gender balance in positions directly below the management body, institutions will be able to better take into account gender diversity when recruiting members of the management body (see also Art. 91 CRD). The guidelines have been revised and fully aligned with the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. Question 6 Corporate values and code of conduct - tax offences - illicit dividend arbitrage schemes Para. 101(c) Several respondents suggest deleting the provision on tax offences, but in particular on dividend arbitrage schemes, deeming it unnecessary, too vague and not appropriate to specifically point out to one particular kind of tax evasion scheme. The word 'illicit' is not sufficiently clear. Alternatively, it was suggested by some respondents to limit this provision to cases where a court decision or a decision from the AML/CFT supervisor has been issued or where the competent authority have found a particular practice to be illicit. One respondent asks for clarification of the obligation on banks to prevent tax crimes. The amendment of the guidelines is necessary to stress that tax offences are a relevant factor that should be considered within the code of conduct. The term 'illicit' covers schemes that are unlawful or are banned; the wording has been clarified. Institutions have no active role in prosecuting clients for committing tax crimes, but, as part of money laundering controls, institutions must have appropriate controls to prevent them being used by customers for money laundering, including the use of funds derived from tax offences, purposes. GL amended 80 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA analysis Amendments to the proposals Para. 106 and Para. 126: documentation of conflicts of interest Some respondents urge the need for more proportionality, deeming that a detailed documentation and measures should not be required for every minor or merely theoretical conflict of interest. Suggestion to clarify as follows: 'If a notable conflict of interest is identified'. The guidelines in Para. 106 have been clarified, in some cases minor conflicts of interest may be accepted without specific measures taken. COI should still be documented. The awareness of such conflicts should already be a sufficient control measure in some cases and the controls in place can in such cases be considered as sufficient. GL amended Question 7. Section 11 has been added to provide guidelines on loans and transactions with members of the management body and their related parties, reflecting changes to the CRD. Is the section appropriate and sufficiently clear? Loans and other transactions with members of the management body and their related parties Legal basis Most respondents raised that there is a lack of legal basis to extend the provisions to other transactions, observing that the CRD V does not provide for the setting up of a monitoring framework or approval process or limits to transactions with members of the management body and their related parties. Moreover, the scope of other transactions is very wide and would lead to excessive burden. The guidelines have been revised to provide guidance on the documentation on related party loans and the management of conflicts of interest in relation to loans and transactions with members of the management body and related parties. For both, Article 88 CRD and Article 16 EBA founding regulation provide for a clear legal basis. While there is an obligation on institutions to be able to submit certain information under Art. 88 CRD to their competent authority and there is a definition of related parties, the guidelines do not foresee a limitation of loans or transactions, but the consultation paper (CP) foresees that institutions should set limits in their policy, which could be overruled by the management body. GL amended The guidelines have been reworded to make clear that there should be thresholds that trigger decision-making at the level of the management body. Loans and transactions members of other with the The requirement to make available annually to shareholders appropriate aggregated information is criticised for lacking a legal basis in the CRD. Institutions are subject to the provisions within the CRD, MiFID and when listed the SRD. GL amended All of the requirements need to be complied with at the same time. The EBA is aware that national laws exist that transpose those EU 81 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA analysis Amendments to the proposals management body and their related parties Some respondents find the proposed provisions disproportionate, as they are even stricter than the rules Directives. The EBA guidelines aim to achieve a harmonised application of the provisions in the EU that are within the EBA's Relation to shareholder rights directive (SRD) and national law provided for in SRD. Moreover, listed credit institutions would be subject to two different and complex regimes for related party transactions, leading to unreasonable administrative burden and costs. Overlaps are also highlighted with IAS24 disclosure requirements. scope of action. The guidelines have been revised and aligned with the CRD requirements, without providing guidelines on requirements under the SRD with which some institutions have to comply. According to SRD only material related party transactions are subject to approval and disclosure requirements and the SRD provides for several exemptions (e.g. for subsidiaries). Additionally, several respondents highlight possible overlapping with national requirements that already provide for related parties transactions. Loans and other The provisions in the guidelines on related party loans and transactions with A few respondents point to overlaps with the existing transactions are a specific form of measures to manage conflicts of members of the control frameworks that aim to control similar risks and interests. The obligation to manage such conflicts is part of the CRD management body and propose to take a more flexible approach. and while the EBA has identified some additional costs for the their related parties Some respondents also observe that this section would implementation of the CRD provisions, the guidelines specify those provisions and those additional elements add only very limited to\nthe costs created by the CRD provisions. Institutions document all loans and transactions; while this contains personal data, this is a normal and necessary business practice. The GL have been revised to reduce the documentation burden. GL amended Overlap with existing control framework and compliance costs impose new compliance costs on credit institutions (e.g., review of procedures and IT systems) at a very inopportune moment (i.e., COVID-19 crisis). Confidentiality/Data protection issues have also been raised. Loans and other transactions with members of the With regard to banking groups, a few respondents suggest clarifying that this section is not applicable to loans granted to board members of other group entities, being only The relevant provisions within the CRD apply on an individual and consolidated basis. The guidelines have been clarified. E.g. loans by the consolidated institution to a member of the management body of a subsidiary, that does not fall under the GL amended 82 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA analysis Amendments to the proposals management body and their related parties Application on a consolidated level addressed to loans made by the parent bank to its own board members and their related parties. On the issue of intra-group transactions, a few respondents suggest, in line with Para. 116, to clarify that situations in which there is no conflict of interest, although loans or transactions are performed with a 'related party' as per the definition of Article 88(1) CRD, such loans or transactions can be excluded from additional requirements. The proposed exclusion would apply, for instance, to transactions with (i) the sole shareholder; (ii) subsidiaries or (iii) commercial entities (corporate banking) including, for example, companies where a close family member holds a senior management position or has a share of 10%; or entities where the board member has no influence (for example where the board member holds a non-executive directorship and where decisions are taken collectively); (iv) shareholders and companies on which the credit institution exerts control or significant influence; (v) the shareholder of the credit institution who is represented in the supervisory function of the management body by its managing director or a person with a senior management position; (vi) the management board member who holds a supervisory board function in a subsidiary. definition of a related party at the consolidated level, are not considered to be related party loans. However, loans by the subsidiary to the members of its management body are related party loans, even if they were subsidiaries within a group and additional controls are applied on a group level. The proposed exclusions have not been included in the guidelines with regard to the documentation to related party loans, as otherwise there would not be a record of the assessment of conflicts of interest and no possibility for further follow ups if the situation changes, nor the possibility to provide aggregated data. Loans and other transactions with members of the\nmanagement body and their related parties With regard to the application in cooperative credit institutions, some respondents find the requirements\ninappropriate, because in these banks directors are by\ndefinition clients. Therefore, it would become very difficult to find clients who accept to become involved in the management body The requirements regarding related party loans are encoded within the CRD. They apply also to cooperative banks. Article 88 CRD requires all institutions to manage conflicts of interest. All those requirements apply also to cooperative banks.

Some other respondents observe that the GL do not clearly set a materiality threshold and, therefore, since a materiality threshold could already be in place in the national legal frameworks, they suggest that the GL refer to national laws. The provisions within the CRD apply to all related party loans. The guidelines follow this approach and already foresee a differentiation between material and non-material loans. The GL aim to harmonise the application in all Member States. This cannot be achieved by references to national law. members of\nmanagement body\ntheir related parties Materiality threshold It should be noted that the GL already indicated a threshold that aimed at reducing the burden for supervisors and institutions regarding the review of such loans. GL amended For the management of conflict of interest, additional guidelines have been provided that take into account the materiality of such loans and transactions. The materiality threshold has to be set by institutions. The guidelines have been reviewed and clarified to reduce the burden for institutions with regard to non-material loans and transactions. Loans and\ntransactions other\nwith the\nand With regard to the requirement to make available, without undue delay, the documentation to competent authorities, several respondents suggest deleting it because it is excessively burdensome and difficult to implement for complex loans. Institutions must comply with all requirements under the CRD and the CRR and it must be possible to exercise effective supervision. The term 'undue delay' already allows for the needed flexibility and reflects the provision within Article 88 CRD with regard to related party loans. No change members of\nmanagement body\ntheir related parties Supervisory reporting Given other revisions to this section, the additional burden created appears to be acceptable and is mainly caused by the provision within the CRD. 84 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA analysis Amendments to the proposals Loans and other Some respondents raise confidentiality/data protection Disclosure requirements already exist under the CRR and under transactions with issues; others evidence possible conflicts with some IAS24. The guidelines have been revised to ensure that they are fully members of the national legal frameworks. in line with the legal requirements under the CRD and CRR; in management body\ntheir related parties and Moreover, it would be problematic to require cooperative banks to disclose aggregated information as the particular, some disclosure and reporting requirements to shareholders have been removed or revised. The publication of aggregated information as required under the CRR should not raise concerns under data protection requirements. GL amended Disclosure and reporting to shareholders management body members might be well known at the regional level. Loans and other With regard to the possibility to allow credit institutions to transactions with identify additional categories of related parties, some members of the respondents complain that the GL adopt an inconsistent The guidelines follow the approach taken in the CRD, but leaves it management body\ntheir related parties and approach since, on the one side, they remove flexibility in the procedure to be adopted as well as the possibility to to institutions to apply, if they deem it necessary, to extend the scope of related parties. This could e.g. be necessary where GL amended Additional related parties utilise the existing frameworks and, on the other side, they leave flexibility on the scope of related parties, which is defined in great detail in the CRD V. required under national law. The text has been clarified. Some respondents raise confidentiality/data protection issues and the right to informational self-determination of the relatives concerned. They note that a mandatory notification from a circle of related parties enlarged by parents and grown-up children The declaration of members of the management body of their conflicts of interests with regard to loans to related parties and other transactions is a part of the measures necessary to manage conflicts of interest and to ensure objective decision-making regarding such loans and transactions. Section 11, related party loans and transactions presumes that there is in fact legal authority for the legally- binding collection of data by a member of the management body, otherwise the management body member/institution bears the objective risk that relevant data, e.g., from his/her majority aged children or parents, cannot be obtained in their entirety. From a purely factual standpoint, this then raises the question whether a nearly complete establishment and ongoing updating of the Institutions in any case keep data on loans and transactions. Marking loans, as related party loan is an additional element that is necessary to comply with the requirement under the CRD. The provisions have been revised and specified to reduce the regulatory burden. However, the identification of related parties is necessary to comply with the requirements under Art. 88 CRD. GL amended 85 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA analysis Amendments to the proposals shareholding/ownership structure of each institution is even possible. Related party loans and transactions Single respondents suggest enriching the section by including (i) additional guidelines or limits for secured vs. unsecured credit exposure extended to insiders; (ii) annual submission of the related interest attestation from the members containing a list of all organisations in which they have regulatory significant interest in or are in a position to make or influence significant business decisions or impacting financial profitability of the related company. Several respondents suggest further specifying that only loans that are classified as material and have been concluded under better conditions than standard conditions are subject to increased documentation or approval requirements. All loans to related parties must be documented and submitted to the competent authority (CA) upon request, regardless whether they are secured or not. Also decisions on secured loans should not be taken by staff that has material conflicts of interest. Institutions have to manage conflicts of interests; as part of this they may require annual declarations, however, as a general obligation this would be too burdensome. No change Para. 107 to 109 One respondent suggests carefully reviewing the wording for consistency, for instance, the terms 'framework', 'decision', and 'procedure' are used frequently in different contexts (mainly Para. 107, 108 and 109) and to provide further guidance on the elements expected that should be specified in the related party framework, e.g., a decision- making process (including approvals), internal procedures, policies. The guidelines are considered sufficiently clear and have not been changed compared to the guidelines in force. No change Para. 107 - arm's length conditions Some respondents claim that there is no legal basis to prescribe arm's length conditions for private-law agreements in general. The wording should be clarified as follows: 'Such a framework should include limits for loans and transactions (e.g. per product type) and ensure that The arm's length principle is the condition that the parties of a transaction are independent and on an equal footing, which leads usually to conditions that are fair for all concerned parties, including the institution's shareholders. Where transactions are not conducted under market conditions, the inappropriate GL amended 86 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA analysis Amendments to the proposals they are either conducted at arm's length or deviations are documented.' Another respondent felt that the restriction to 'conditions available to staff' is not necessary. management of conflicts of interest might be the reason for such decisions. However, it is accepted that special conditions are provided to staff. There are however some limits in national law that must be considered. The guidelines have been clarified. Para. 107: content of the framework - loans fair from the perspective of the shareholders or owners As for the distinction between the transactions carried out on normal market terms and the transactions which are considered fair and reasonable from the perspective of the institution and of the shareholders, it is suggested to limit the assessment to the perspective of the institution, taking into account its safe and sound management. Therefore, the assessment should not be extended to the interests of the shareholders or owners of the bank. The institution is owned by shareholders or equity holders and therefore they need to be considered when assessing conflicts of\ninterest. No change Para. 108: decision on material loans - approval by the management body Some respondents seek further clarification deeming unclear when a person is considered 'personally concerned by a loan to or transaction with a member of the management body or their related parties'. They suggest clarifying that a loan granted to a commercial entity, which is a related party to a management body member, does not automatically result in the qualification of that management body member as 'personally concerned' (in its personal interests). The guidelines have been clarified, the person concerned is the person who, because of the relation to a party, actually or potentially has a conflict of interest and should therefore not influence the specific decision made. GL amended Para. 112: data on loans to be documented Some respondents suggest that the identification of the details on the loans to be provided should be left to entities in accordance with local regulations and internal procedures: the day-to-day IT management of credits and the associated risks is the core business of banks and the EBA should not interfere in this field. In particular, this Institutions document each and every contract they have. For all related party loans, institutions must ensure that they can provide competent authorities with the information requested regarding related party loans. The guidelines specify this provision. Moreover, competent authorities must also be able to effectively supervise institutions, including, e.g. the management of conflicts GL amended 87 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA analysis Amendments to the proposals paragraph 112 does not make any difference between the type of loans and as such is much too broad. Others view that the requirements are too extensive. of interest that is required under Article 88(1) CRD. The guidelines have been revised and clarified. Para. 112 (d) and (g) Loans and other transactions with members of the management body and their related parties The GL do not define how to calculate the EUR 200 000 threshold; one respondent requests indications on how to calculate the threshold of loans (e.g., should all respective transactions related to a member of the management body and their related parties be taken jointly into consideration or should each transaction be examined separately?). Some respondents ask to clarify how data should be aggregated. The guidelines have been clarified. GL amended Question 8. Paragraph 126 has been added, is it sufficiently clear? Para. 126 Documentation of conflicts of interest - see Para. 106. Please refer to comments (Para. 106) above. Para. 129: Internal alert procedures - protection of persons who report breaches of Union law One respondent suggests deleting the added last sentence deeming questionable whether there is any added value to insert a requirement to ensure that credit institutions are compliant with national law in one certain aspect. While institutions have to comply with national law, this additional aspect, that has been introduced only recently, has been retained No change in the guidelines for the sake of completeness. Question 9 Para. 140 and 149: ML/FT risks in the internal control framework – general comment Several respondents deem that more proportionality is needed regarding the measures to mitigate operational and reputational risks arising from ML/TF risk factors. The risks caused depend on the nature and complexity of individual business activities. This should be clarified as follows: 'and take mitigating measures to reduce those risks as well as, where relevant, their operational and reputational risks linked to them.' All banks are exposed to such risks, but to a different level. They need to be identified and should form part of the holistic view on all risks. However, not every risk needs to be mitigated. Measures should be taken on a risk-based approach. Paragraph 140 has been GL amended clarified. 88 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA analysis Amendments to the proposals AML training One respondent suggests, in the phrasing of the last paragraph concerning staff, to expand to continuous efforts by companies, i.e., 'Credit institutions should take continuous measures to ensure that their staff is made aware ( ... )'. The guidelines already contain that staff should receive the necessary training on a regular basis. No change AML/TF risk factors One respondent asks if the credit institution should take into account any criteria other than those published by the Commission for the assessment of ML/TF risks. Does the EBA have any additional expectations from the credit institutions apart from the compulsory training of their staff? The EBA has issued guidelines on ML/TF risk factors that should be taken into account. The EBA is going to publish guidelines on the AML/CTF compliance function. All institutions need to comply with the framework set under AMLD, including any delegated regulations, etc. No change AML committee One respondent observes that compliance with AML/CFT regulations should be ensured through adequate and effective internal management structures and appropriate control mechanisms. For this, banks could also form an AML/CFT committee. Institutions can set up an AML committee. However, one person has to be responsible for AML/CTF compliance. No change Para. 143: Implementing an internal control framework (and Para. 166 internal control functions) Some respondents suggest clarifying which 'other' compliance functions are referred to. Some of them ask for clarification that the reference to compliance may be covered by a separate Anti-Financial Crime (AFC) function, if this exists within an organisation. Consequently it is suggested including either AFC in the definition of 'compliance' or in a second sentence before internal audit in Para. 166. One of the respondents asks if AML/TF shall be a separate control function. The guidelines do not aim at requiring additional control functions, but allow for them to be installed by the institution. It is not uncommon that larger institutions have separate control functions that are, as a second line of defence, responsible for overseeing and managing AML risks. Institutions e.g. may also have a separate function for information security risks. However, the guidelines leave it to institutions to set up additional control functions, determine their scope of action and label them. No change 89 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA analysis Amendments to the proposals Para. 164: New products and significant changes - ML/CF associated risks One respondent observes that the requirement to take ML/TF risks into account in new-product processes is superfluous since it is already the subject of European supervisory regulations/circulars. The inclusion in the guidelines aims at raising the awareness on this important risk factor, its assessment and documentation, including in the new product approval process. No change Para. 166: AML/CFT in internal control functions - general comment Some respondents ask for clarification on whether the control functions are supposed to cover new/additional tasks or if AML/CTF aspects shall be integrated into the respective department. On this, one respondent suggests stating that the AML/CFT compliance should be ensured by the compliance department or another department. See also comments under Para. 143. The same as with all risks, ML/TF risks are managed by the first line of defence and the second line of defence, which ensures the compliance with AML/CTF related provision and oversees and supports the first line of defence. Institutions may set up an AML/CTF compliance function or integrate it into the compliance function. The guidelines have been clarified. GL amended Para. 208: Compliance function - fraud, ML/TF or other financial crime One respondent suggests deleting the part of sentence 'ML/TF or other financial crime', as this is the responsibility of the AML Department and any overlaps in responsibilities or tasks with the Compliance Department, which belongs to the same line of defence, must be avoided. While institutions may have an independent AML department, other institutions may have this function performed by the compliance function. The AML/CTF compliance function should be independent from the business it controls. Also the business has to implement appropriate AML/CTF controls. No change Para. 210 - 220: Internal audit function One respondent highlights that internal audit is more and more assessing outsourced activities as banks outsource more and more operations; therefore, it suggests to explicitly mention that 'Every activity (including outsourced activities) and every entity of the bank should fall within the overall scope of the internal audit function.' All activities and functions of the institution are within the audit universe. This does not change when activities or functions are outsourced. This principle is encoded within the EBA Guidelines on outsourcing. No change Para. 223: Business continuity management - HR Some respondents suggest that 'core human resources' should refer to 'core staff/employees' so it is clear that it does not refer to HR department. The comment has been accommodated. GL amended 90 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INTERNAL GOVERNANCE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received The EBA analysis Amendments to the proposals Para. 224: continuity\nplan Business\nmanagement One respondent deems unclear how the inclusion of the word 'drivers' changes the intended meaning of this requirement. The additional wording clarifies that institutions should also look into the risk factors (drivers) that can lead to severe business disruptions.

Draft cost-benefit analysis / impact assessment 77 3 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE ASSESSMENT OF THE SUITABILITY OF MEMBERS OF THE MANAGEMENT BODY AND KEY FUNCTION HOLDERS esma European Securities and Markets Authority EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Executive Summary In accordance with the requirements introduced by Directive 2013/36/EU as amended by Directive 2019/878/EU and Directive 2014/65/EU, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European Banking Authority (EBA) jointly issue Guidelines on the notions of suitability, as required by Article 91 (12) of Directive 2013/36/EU and Article 9 (1) of Directive 2014/65/EU1, and on the assessment of suitability by institutions and competent authorities. The directives aim to remedy weaknesses that were identified during the financial crisis regarding the functioning of the management body and its members. The Guidelines aim to further improve and harmonise the assessment of suitability within the EU financial sector, and to ensure sound governance arrangements in institutions. The Guidelines apply to all institutions, independent of their governance structures (unitary board, dual board or other structures), without advocating or preferring any specific structure as set out in the defined scope of application. The terms 'management body in its management function' and 'management body in its supervisory function' should be interpreted throughout the Guidelines in accordance with the applicable law within each Member State. The Guidelines specify that all institutions have to assess the members of the management body. Institutions that are subject to Directive 2013/36/EU also have to assess all key function holders that have a significant influence over the direction of the institution under the overall responsibility of the management body. Competent authorities are required to assess all members of the management body. For significant CRD institutions, competent authorities should assess the heads of internal control functions and the chief financial officer (CFO), where they are not members of the management body. This should be done at the highest level of consolidation for significant CRD institutions that are part of a group but not subject to prudential consolidation by a significant consolidating CRD institution, and at the individual level if the significant CRD institution is not part of a group. The Guidelines provide common criteria to assess the individual and collective knowledge, skills and experience of members of the management body as well as their good repute, honesty and integrity, and independence of mind. The Guidelines take into account the changes introduced by Directive 2019/878/EU with regard to the consideration of money laundering and terrorist financing risks and criteria for assessing the independence of mind of members of the management body. To ensure that members of the management body commit sufficient time to performing their functions, the Guidelines set a 1 Directive 2014/65/EU entered into application on 3 January 2018. 4 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE ASSESSMENT OF THE SUITABILITY OF MEMBERS OF THE MANAGEMENT BODY AND KEY FUNCTION HOLDERS esma European Securities and Markets Authority EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY framework for assessing the time commitment expected of members of the management body and specify how the number of directorships is to be counted. It is important to improve the diversity of management bodies to overcome the risk of groupthink; to this end, the Guidelines determine how diversity is to be taken into account in the process for selecting members of the management body. In particular, institutions should take measures to ensure that gender balance is taken into account when selecting members of the management body. Induction and training are key to ensuring the initial and ongoing suitability of members of the management body; institutions are therefore required to establish training policies and to provide for appropriate financial and human resources to be devoted to induction and training. 5 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE ASSESSMENT OF THE SUITABILITY OF MEMBERS OF THE MANAGEMENT BODY AND KEY FUNCTION HOLDERS esma European Securities and Markets Authority EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Background and rationale",
            "1. Weaknesses in corporate governance, including inadequate oversight by and challenge from the supervisory function of the management body in a number of credit institutions and investment firms, have contributed to excessive and imprudent risk-taking in the financial sector which has led in turn to the failure of individual institutions and systemic problems.",
            "2. Against this background, it has become obvious that the role and responsibilities of management bodies in both their supervisory and management functions should be strengthened in order to ensure sound and prudent management of credit institutions and investment firms, to protect the integrity of the market and the interest of consumers.",
            "3. Directive 2013/36/EU as amended by Directive 2019/878/EU and Directive 2014/65/EU include requirements to remedy weaknesses that were identified during the financial crisis regarding the functioning and composition of the management body and the qualification of its members.",
            "4. The Guidelines are intended to apply to all existing board structures and do not advocate any particular structure. The Guidelines do not interfere with the general allocation of competences in accordance with national company law. Accordingly, they should be applied irrespective of the board structures used (unitary and/or dual board structure and/or other structures) across Member States. The management body, as defined in points (7) and (8) of Article 3(1) of Directive 2013/36/EU, should be understood as having management (executive) and supervisory (non-executive) functions.",
            "5. The terms 'management body in its management function' and 'management body in its supervisory function' are used throughout these Guidelines without referring to any specific governance structure and references to the management (executive) or supervisory (non- executive) function should be understood as applying to the bodies or members of the management body responsible for that function in accordance with national law.",
            "6. In Member States where the management body delegates, partially or fully, the executive function to a person or an internal executive body (e.g. chief executive officer (CEO), management team or executive committee), the persons who perform those executive functions on the basis of that delegation should be understood as constituting the management function of the management body. For the purposes of these Guidelines any reference to the management body in its management function should be understood as including also the members of the executive body or the CEO, as defined in these Guidelines, even if they have not been proposed or appointed as formal members of the institution's governing body or bodies under national law. 6 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE ASSESSMENT OF THE SUITABILITY OF MEMBERS OF THE MANAGEMENT BODY AND KEY FUNCTION HOLDERS esma European Securities and Markets Authority EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY",
            "7. The management body is empowered to set the institution's strategy, objectives and overall direction, and oversees and monitors management decision-making. The management body in its management function directs the institution. Senior management is accountable to the management body for the day-to-day running of the institution. The management body in its supervisory function oversees and challenges the management function and provides appropriate advice. The oversight roles include reviewing the performance of the management function and the achievement of objectives, and monitoring and ensuring the integrity of financial information as well as the soundness and effectiveness of the risk management and internal controls.",
            "8. Considering all existing governance structures provided for by national laws, competent authorities should ensure the effective and consistent application of the Guidelines in their jurisdiction in accordance with the rationale and objectives of the Guidelines themselves. For this purpose, competent authorities may clarify the governing bodies and functions to which the tasks and responsibilities set forth in the Guidelines pertain, when this is appropriate to ensure the proper application of the Guidelines in accordance with the governance structures provided for under the national company law.",
            "9. Investment firms as defined by and falling under the scope of Directive 2014/65/EU may be set up as limited companies or as other legal forms, including those cases where investment firms are natural persons or investment firms are legal persons managed by a single natural person (as described under Article 9(6) of MiFID II). In some situations, the management body may comprise a small group of individuals who will each perform both executive and supervisory functions. Where these Guidelines refer to the management body in its management and supervisory functions, and, pursuant to national law, these functions are not assigned to different bodies or different members within one body, the activities of both functions should nonetheless be performed by the management body.",
            "10. Branches in a Member State of institutions authorised in a third country are subject to suitability requirements equivalent to those applicable to institutions within Member States. As those branches do not have a management body independent of their head office, such branches and competent authorities should assess the individuals who effectively direct the branch. For the assessment of the suitability of the CFO, the heads of internal control functions and, where identified by branches in a risk-based approach, other key function holders, it is expected that competent authorities apply these Guidelines by analogy.",
            "11. These Guidelines set out the measures for the assessment of the suitability of members of the management body, including the CEO, even when he or she is not part of the institution's governing body or bodies in accordance with national law. The Guidelines also foresee the assessment of the relevant institution's key function holders (i.e. the CFO and the heads of internal control functions where they are not part of the management body and, where identified by relevant institutions in a risk-based approach, other key function holders) who have a significant influence over the direction of the business. These assessments are considered to be proportionate to ensure robust governance arrangements that ensure the 7 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE ASSESSMENT OF THE SUITABILITY OF MEMBERS OF THE MANAGEMENT BODY AND KEY FUNCTION HOLDERS esma European Securities and Markets Authority EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY effective and prudent management of institutions as required in particular by Articles 74, 88 and 91 of Directive 2013/36/EU.",
            "12. Where the Guidelines refer to the CEO, CFO, heads of internal control functions and other key function holders, they do not intend to impose the appointment of such persons unless prescribed by the relevant EU or national law. If activities of an internal control function are performed by an outsourcing provider, the management body retains responsibility for the activities performed on behalf of the institution.",
            "13. Other than for the purposes of the legislation applicable to institutions specifically under Directive 2013/36/EU and Directive 2014/65/EU, the Guidelines do not aim to interfere with other legislation such as social, company or labour law, which needs to be complied with by institutions together with other and independently of EU legislation. Those laws in Member States appear to be divergent across the EU and limit the possible level of harmonisation in this particular area.",
            "14. The Guidelines take into account the European Commission's recommendation of 15 February 20052 on the role of non-executive or supervisory directors of listed companies and on the committees of the supervisory board, and the results of the EBA's review of its Guidelines on the assessment of the suitability of members of the management body and key function holders of credit institutions.",

The joint adoption of these Guidelines is related to the relevant competences of the EBA and ESMA.

            "47. Institutions are primarily responsible for ensuring that members of the management body fulfil the suitability criteria as defined in the Guidelines on an ongoing basis, and need to establish appropriate policies and procedures for this purpose. The nomination committee required for significant CRD institutions has a key role in assessing the suitability, diversity and composition of the management body. Where no nomination committee is established, the management body in its supervisory function as part of the institution's governance arrangements is responsible for fulfilling the tasks that are normally performed by the nomination committee, to ensure the effective and prudent management of the institution and the effectiveness of the institution's governance arrangements.",
            "48. Institutions should assess the suitability of proposed members and members of the management body prior to their appointment or when duly justified as soon as practicable, but in any case within one month of the appointment, and should inform the competent authority of the proposed appointment or without delay after the appointment. Indeed, where shareholders nominate and appoint members of the management body at the general assembly, a prior assessment may not always be possible.",
            "49. Competent authorities should have processes in place for the assessment of the suitability of members of the management body of all institutions and the heads of internal control functions and the CFOs of significant CRD institutions, where they are not part of the management body, as set out in the Guidelines. Competent authorities may choose to assess a broader scope of key function holders. In particular competent authorities' processes should ensure that all these persons are assessed in a timely manner.",
            "50. The Guidelines do not harmonise the point in time when assessments of the suitability of members of the management body should be made. While an assessment before a member takes up the position would ensure that the member is suitable from the beginning of his or her mandate, the Guidelines took into account the practicalities under such a process. A higher level of harmonisation would be desirable within the banking union, but could not be achieved in the current circumstances due, among other things, to the existing fragmented national frameworks.",
            "51. The suitability assessment conducted by competent authorities is prudential and preventive in nature and highly dependent on the available information. It is distinct from criminal or administrative infringement procedures. Institutions have to ensure that members of the management body and key function holders are suitable for their respective roles. When concerns have been raised, it is up to the institution to demonstrate that the individual meets reputation, honesty and integrity standards. In this respect, competent authorities are also required to verify whether the suitability requirements under CRD and MiFID as further specified in these Guidelines are still fulfilled where they have reasonable grounds to suspect 14 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE ASSESSMENT OF THE SUITABILITY OF MEMBERS OF THE MANAGEMENT BODY AND KEY FUNCTION HOLDERS esma European Securities and Markets Authority EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY that money laundering or terrorist financing is being or has been committed or attempted, or there is increased risk thereof in connection with that institution.",
            "52. Preventing money laundering and terrorist financing is essential for maintaining the stability and integrity of the financial system. Involvement of an institution in money laundering and terrorist financing might have an impact on its viability and the trust in the financial system. Directive (EU) 2015/849 (AMLD), in line with international standards for the prevention of money laundering and countering terrorist financing (AML/CFT) set by the Financial Action Task Force, stresses the importance of senior management taking responsibility for the identification, assessment and management of ML/TF risks and requires, without prejudice to the national transposition of Directive 2015/849/EU, institutions to identify the member of the management board7 who is responsible for the implementation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with AMLD.",

            "54. Against this background, institutions and competent authorities should be aware of the negative impact on an institution's safety and soundness that could be produced in the event of a possible involvement of a member of the management body and/or a key function holder in ML/TF or of the institution being unwilling to take robust action to manage the risk of the institution's involvement in ML/TF.",
            "55. Together with competent authorities responsible for ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering requirements under Directive (EU) 2015/849 (AML Supervisors) and other relevant bodies (such as Financial Intelligence Units), competent authorities have an important role to play in identifying and tackling weaknesses in institutions' AML/CFT systems and controls. In this context, the Guidelines clarify in line with Directive 2013/36/EU that the knowledge, experience and skill requirements of at least the member of the management body who is responsible for the implementation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with AMLD include identifying, managing and mitigating money laundering and financing of terrorism risk. The Guidelines also clarify that the ability to understand ML/TF risks is part of the assessments of the collective suitability of the members of the management body and the assessment of key function holders."

However, competent authorities are not limited to this information; e.g. within the supervisory process, a competent authority can also gather additional information on the suitability of persons. Relevant information that can be taken into account in the assessment of suitability can also come from other sources, such as internal whistleblowing or from external sources, when this information is deemed to be reliable.",

It is important to ensure that institutions and competent authorities intervene if a member of the management body, a member proposed for such a position or the management body collectively is not suitable. This also applies to key function holders. Measures available to competent authorities may differ between Member States depending on the applicable national laws. Such measures can range from imposing conditions to ordering an institution to take action to improve the skills and knowledge of a member, or to transferring responsibilities between members, prohibiting a member or an institution from performing tasks, temporarily banning or replacing a member of the management body, or ultimately withdrawing the institution's authorisation. However, if a member of the management body is not suitable, competent authorities have the power to remove such a person from that position.",
            "59. The Guidelines also take into account the recovery and resolution framework introduced by Directive 2014/59/EU (BRRD) and provide further guidance in this regard. During resolution and also as part of early intervention measures, the suitability of newly appointed members of the management body and of the management body collectively is relevant in accordance with Articles 27, 28 and 34(1)(c) of BRRD. The Guidelines aim to ensure that such assessments are conducted in an appropriate timeframe, considering the urgency of the situation, and that there is an appropriate interaction between competent authorities and resolution authorities. In contrast, the assessment of special managers under Article 35(1) of BRRD falls exclusively within the competence of resolution authorities, which appoint a special manager under the conditions of Article 35(1) of BRRD, namely an assessment of whether the special manager has the qualifications, ability and knowledge required to carry out his or her functions. This appointment does not depend on the assessment of the competent authority."

The systems and controls that firms should put in place to ensure their individual and business-wide risk assessments remain up to date should include: a) Setting a date for each calendar year on which the next business-wide risk assessment update will take place, and setting a date on a risk sensitive basis for the individual risk assessment to ensure new or emerging risks are included. b) Where the firm becomes aware before that date that a new ML/TF risk has emerged, or an existing one has increased, this should be reflected in their individual and business-wide risk assessments as soon as possible; and ) Carefully recording issues throughout the relevant period that could have a bearing on risk assessments, such as internal suspicious transaction reports, compliance failures and intelligence from front office staff.",

In respect of individual risk assessments, a. terror alerts and financial sanctions regimes, or changes thereto, as soon as they are issued or communicated and ensure that these are acted upon as necessary; and b. media reports that are relevant to the sectors or jurisdictions in which the firm is active. 8 ii.

Firms should ensure that their business-wide risk assessment is tailored to their business profile and takes into account the factors and risks specific to the firm's business, whether the firm draws up its own business-wide risk assessment or contracts an external party to draw up its business-wide risk assessment. Similarly, where a firm is part of a group that draws up a group-wide risk assessment, the firm should consider whether the group-wide risk assessment is sufficiently granular and specific to reflect the firm's business and the risks 9 to which it is exposed as a result of the group's links to countries and geographical areas, and complement the group-wide risk assessment if necessary. If the group is headquartered in a country associated with a high level of corruption, the firm should reflect this in its risk assessment even if the group-wide risk assessment stays silent on this point.",

Where the risk associated with a business relationship is likely to be low, and to the extent permitted by national legislation, firms may be able to apply simplified customer due diligence measures (SDD).

When identifying the risk associated with their customers, including their customers' beneficial owners, firms should consider the risk related to: a) the customer's and the customer's beneficial owner's business or professional activity; b) the customer's and the customer's beneficial owner's reputation; and c) the customer's and the customer's beneficial owner's nature and behaviour, including whether this could point to increased TF risk.",
            "2.4. Risk factors that may be relevant when identifying the risk associated with a customer's or a customer's beneficial owner's business or professional activity include: a) Does the customer or beneficial owner have links to sectors that are commonly associated with higher corruption risk, such as construction, pharmaceuticals and healthcare, the arms trade and defence, the extractive industries or public procurement? b) Does the customer or beneficial owner have links to sectors that are associated with higher ML/TF risk, for example certain Money Service Businesses, casinos or dealers in precious metals? 13 c) Does the customer or beneficial owner have links to sectors that involve significant amounts of cash? d) Where the customer is a legal person, trust, or other type of legal arrangement, what is the purpose of their establishment? For example, what is the nature of their business? e) Does the customer have political connections, for example, are they a Politically Exposed Person (PEP), or is their beneficial owner a PEP? Does the customer or beneficial owner have any other relevant links to a PEP, for example are any of the customer's directors PEPs and, if so, do these PEPs exercise significant control over the customer or beneficial owner? Where a customer or their beneficial owner is a PEP, firms must always apply EDD measures in line with Article 20 of Directive (EU) 2015/849. f) Does the customer or beneficial owner hold another prominent position or enjoy a high public profile that might enable them to abuse this position for private gain? For example, are they senior local or regional public officials with the ability to influence the awarding of public contracts, decision-making members of high-profile sporting bodies or individuals who are known to influence the government and other senior decision-makers? g) Is the customer a legal person subject to enforceable disclosure requirements that ensure that reliable information about the customer's beneficial owner is publicly available, for example public companies listed on stock exchanges that make such disclosure a condition for listing? h) Is the customer a credit or financial institution acting on its own account from a jurisdiction with an effective AML/CFT regime and is it supervised for compliance with local AML/CFT obligations? Is there evidence that the customer has been subject to supervisory sanctions or enforcement for failure to comply with AML/CFT obligations or wider conduct requirements in recent years? i) Is the customer a public administration or enterprise from a jurisdiction with low levels of corruption? j) Is the customer's or the beneficial owner's background consistent with what the firm knows about their former, current or planned business activity, their business's turnover, the source of funds and the customer's or beneficial owner's source of wealth?",
            "2.5. The following risk factors may be relevant when identifying the risk associated with a customer's or beneficial owners' reputation: 14 a) Are there adverse media reports or other relevant sources of information about the customer, for example are there any allegations of criminality or terrorism against the customer or the beneficial owner? If so, are these reliable and credible? Firms should determine the credibility of allegations on the basis of the quality and independence of the source of the data and the persistence of reporting of these allegations, among other considerations. Firms should note that the absence of criminal convictions alone may not be sufficient to dismiss allegations of wrongdoing. b) Has the customer, beneficial owner or anyone publicly known to be closely associated with them had their assets frozen due to administrative or criminal proceedings or allegations of terrorism or terrorist financing? Does the firm have reasonable grounds to suspect that the customer or beneficial owner or anyone publicly known to be closely associated with them has, at some point in the past, been subject to such an asset freeze? c) Does the firm know if the customer or beneficial owner has been the subject of a suspicious transactions report in the past? d) Does the firm have any in-house information about the customer's or the beneficial owner's integrity, obtained, for example, in the course of a long- standing business relationship?",
            "2.6. The following risk factors may be relevant when identifying the risk associated with a customer's or beneficial owner's nature and behavior. Firms should note that not all of these risk factors will be apparent at the outset; they may emerge only once a business relationship has been established: a) Does the customer have legitimate reasons for being unable to provide robust evidence of their identity, perhaps because they are an asylum seeker? b) Does the firm have any doubts about the veracity or accuracy of the customer's or beneficial owner's identity? c) Are there indications that the customer might seek to avoid the establishment of a business relationship? For example, does the customer look to carry out one transaction or several one-off transactions where the establishment of a business relationship might make more economic sense? d) Is the customer's ownership and control structure transparent and does it make sense? If the customer's ownership and control structure is complex or opaque, is there an obvious commercial or lawful rationale? e) Does the customer issue bearer shares or does it have nominee shareholders? 15 f) Is the customer a legal person or arrangement that could be used as an asset- holding vehicle? g) Is there a sound reason for changes in the customer's ownership and control structure? h) Does the customer request transactions that are complex, unusually or unexpectedly large, have an unusual or unexpected pattern, no apparent economic or lawful purpose, or lack a sound commercial rationale? Are there grounds to suspect that the customer is trying to evade specific thresholds such as those set out in Article 11(b) of Directive (EU) 2015/849 and national law where applicable? i) Does the customer request unnecessary or unreasonable levels of secrecy? For example, is the customer reluctant to share CDD information, or do they appear to want to disguise the true nature of their business? j) Can the customer's or beneficial owner's source of wealth or source of funds be easily explained, for example through their occupation, inheritance or investments? Is the explanation plausible? k) Does the customer use the products and services they have taken out as expected when the business relationship was first established? 1) Where the customer is a non-resident, could their needs be better serviced elsewhere? Is there a sound economic and lawful rationale for the customer requesting the type of financial service sought? Firms should note that Article 16 of Directive 2014/92/EU creates a right for customers who are legally resident in the Union to obtain a basic payment account, but this right applies only to the extent that credit institutions can comply with their AML/CFT obligations as referred to in Articles 1(7) and 16(4) of Directive 2014/92/EU.",
            "2.7. When identifying the risk associated with a customer's or beneficial owner's nature and behaviour, firms should pay particular attention to risk factors that, although not specific to terrorist financing, could point to increased TF risk, in particular in situations where other TF risk factors are also present. To this end, firms should consider at least the following risk factors: a) Is the customer or the beneficial owner a person included in the lists of persons, groups and entities involved in terrorist acts and subject to restrictive measures4, 4 See for instance Council Common Position of 27 December 2001 on the application of specific measures to combat terrorism (2001/931/CFSP)(OJ L 344 , 28.12.2001, p. 0093); Council Regulation (EC) No 2580/2001 of 27 December 2001 on specific restrictive measures directed against certain persons and entities with a view to combating terrorism (OJ L 16 or are they known to have close personal or professional links to persons registered on such lists (for example, because they are in a relationship or otherwise live with such a person)? b) Is the customer or the beneficial owner a person who is publicly known to be under investigation for terrorist activity or has been convicted for terrorist activity, or are they known to have close personal or professional links to such a person (for example, because they are in a relationship or otherwise live with such a person)? c) Does the customer carry out transactions that are characterised by incoming and outgoing fund transfers from and/or to countries where groups committing terrorist offences are known to be operating, that are known to be sources of terrorist financing or that are subject to international sanctions? If so, can these transfers be explained easily through, for example, family ties or commercial relationships? VA1 d) Where the customer is a not-for-profit organisation (NPO), the firms should apply the criteria set out in the annex. VO e) Does the customer carry out transactions characterized by large flows of money in a short period of time, involving non-profit organizations with unclear links (e.g. they are domiciled at the same physical location; they share the same representatives or employees or they hold multiple accounts under the same names)? f) Does the customer transfer or intend to transfer funds to persons referred to in (a) and (b)?",
            "2.8. In addition to the information sources listed in guidelines 1.30 and 1.31, firms should pay particular attention to the FATF's typologies on TF, which are regularly updated.5 Countries and geographical areas 344 28.12.2001, p. 70 ); Council Regulation (EC) No 881/2002 of 27 May 2002 imposing certain specific restrictive measures directed against certain persons and entities associated with the ISIL (Da'esh) and Al-Qaida organisations (OJ L 139 29.5.2002, p. 9).

The following factors may contribute to increasing risk: a) The payee is located in a jurisdiction associated with higher ML/TF risk and/or the product has been issued or receives funds from sources in such a jurisdiction. Firms should pay particular attention to jurisdictions known to provide funding or support for terrorist activities or where groups committing terrorist offences are known to be operating, and jurisdictions subject to financial sanctions, embargoes or measures that are related to terrorism, financing of terrorism or proliferation.

            "10.18.To the extent permitted by national legislation, examples of SDD measures firms may apply in low-risk situations include: a) postponing the verification of the customer's or beneficial owner's identity to a certain later date after the establishment of the relationship or until a certain (low) monetary threshold is exceeded (whichever occurs first). The monetary threshold should not exceed EUR 150 where the product is not reloadable or can be used in other jurisdictions or for cross-border transactions); b) verifying the customer's identity on the basis of a payment drawn on an account in the sole or joint name of the customer or an account over which the customer can be shown to have control with an EEA-regulated credit or financial institution; c) verifying identity on the basis of fewer sources; d) verifying identity on the basis of less reliable sources; e) using alternative methods to verify identity; f) assuming the nature and intended purpose of the business relationship where this is obvious, for example in the case of certain gift cards that do not fall under the closed loop/closed network exemption; 69 g) reducing the intensity of monitoring as long as a certain monetary threshold is not reached. As ongoing monitoring is an important means of obtaining more information on customer risk factors (see above) during the course of a customer relationship, that threshold for both individual transactions and transactions that appear to be linked over the course of 12 months should be set at a level that the firm has assessed as presenting a low risk for both terrorist financing and money laundering purposes. 70 Guideline 11: Sectoral guideline for money remitters",

Money remitters are payment institutions or e-money institutions or credit institutions that have been authorised in line with Directive (EU) 2015/2366 to provide and execute payment services throughout the EU. The businesses in this sector are diverse and range from individual businesses to complex chain operators.",

Agents often provide payment services as an ancillary component to their main business and they may not themselves be obliged entities under applicable AML/CFT legislation; accordingly, their AML/CFT expertise may be limited.",
            "11.3. The nature of the service provided can expose money remitters to ML/TF risk. This is due to the simplicity and speed of transactions, their worldwide reach and their often cash- based character. Furthermore, the nature of this payment service means that money remitters often carry out occasional transactions rather than establishing a business relationship with their customers, which means that their understanding of the ML/TF risk associated with the customer may be limited.",

The customer's business has a complicated ownership structure. iii. The customer's activity could be associated with TF because he is publicly known to have extremism sympathies or are known to be linked to an organised crime group. b) The customer's behaviour: i. The customer's needs may be better serviced elsewhere, for example because the money remitter is not local to the customer or the customer's business. ii. The customer appears to be acting for someone else, for example others watch over the customer or are visible outside the place where the transaction is made, or the customer reads instructions from a note. iii. The customer's behaviour makes no apparent economic sense, for example the customer accepts a poor exchange rate or high charges unquestioningly, requests a transaction in a currency that is not official tender or commonly used in the jurisdiction where the customer and/or recipient is located or requests or provides large amounts of currency in either low or high denominations. iv. The customer's transactions are always just below applicable thresholds, including the CDD threshold for occasional transactions in Article 11(b) of Directive (EU) 2015/849 and the EUR 1 000 threshold specified in Article 5(2) of Regulation (EU) 2015/847.16 Firms should note that the threshold in Article 5(2) of Regulation (EU) 2015/847 applies only to transactions that are not funded by cash or anonymous electronic money. V. The customer's use of the service is unusual, for example they send or receive money to or from themselves or send funds on immediately after receiving them. vi. The customer appears to know little or is reluctant to provide information about the payee. 16 Regulation (EU) 2015/847 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on information accompanying transfers of funds and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1781/2006. 72 vii. Several of the firm's customers transfer funds to the same payee or appear to have the same identification information, for example address or telephone number. viii.

Any enquiry the money remitter makes should be proportionate to the nature, complexity and scale of the ML/TF risk inherent in the payment services provided by the agent and could be based on the money remitter's CDD procedures. c) Taking reasonable measures to satisfy themselves that the agent's AML/CFT internal controls are appropriate and remain appropriate throughout the agency relationship, for example by monitoring a sample of the agent's transactions or reviewing the agent's controls on site. Where an agent's internal AML/CFT controls differ from the money remitter's, for example because the agent represents more than one principal or because the agent is itself an obliged entity under applicable AML/CFT legislation, the money remitter should assess and manage the risk that these differences might affect its own, and the agent's, AML/CFT compliance. d) Providing AML/CFT training to agents to ensure that agents have an adequate understanding of relevant ML/TF risks and the quality of the AML/CFT controls the money remitter expects. 76 Guideline 12: Sectoral guideline for wealth management",

Measures",
            "12.7. The staff member managing a wealth management firm's relationship with a customer (the relationship manager) typically plays a key role in assessing risk. The relationship manager's close contact with the customer will facilitate the collection of information that allows a fuller picture of the purpose and nature of the customer's business to be formed (e.g. an understanding of the client's source of wealth, the destination of funds, why complex or unusual arrangements may nonetheless be genuine and legitimate, or why extra security may be appropriate). This close contact may, however, also lead to conflicts of interest if the relationship manager becomes too close to the customer, to the detriment of the firm's efforts to manage the risk of financial crime. Consequently, independent oversight of risk assessment will also be appropriate, provided by, for example, the compliance department and senior management. Enhanced customer due diligence",

To comply with Article 18a in respect of relationships or transactions involving high-risk third countries, firms should apply the EDD measures set out in this regard in Title I. a) Obtaining and verifying more information about clients than in standard risk situations and reviewing and updating this information both on a regular basis and when prompted by material changes to a client's profile. Firms should perform reviews on a risk-sensitive basis, reviewing higher risk clients at least annually but more frequently if risk dictates. These procedures may include those for recording any visits to clients' premises, whether at their home or business, including any changes to client profile or other information that may affect risk assessment that these visits prompt. b) Establishing the source of wealth and funds; where the risk is particularly high and/or where the firm has doubts about the legitimate origin of the funds, verifying the source of wealth and funds may be the only adequate risk mitigation tool. The source of funds or wealth can be verified, by reference to, inter alia: i. an original or certified copy of a recent pay slip; ii. written confirmation of annual salary signed by an employer; iii. an original or certified copy of contract of sale of, for example, investments or a company; 79 iv. written confirmation of sale signed by a lawyer or solicitor; v. an original or certified copy of a will or grant of probate; vi. written confirmation of inheritance signed by a lawyer, solicitor, trustee or executor; vii. an internet search of a company registry to confirm the sale of a company; viii.

            "13.1. Trade finance means managing a payment to facilitate the movement of goods (and the provision of services) either domestically or across borders. When goods are shipped internationally, the importer faces the risk that the goods will not arrive; while the exporter may be concerned, that payment will not be forthcoming. To lessen these dangers, many trade finance instruments therefore place banks in the middle of the transaction.",
            "13.2. Trade finance can take many different forms. These include: a) 'Open account' transactions: these are transactions where the buyer makes a payment once they have received the goods. These are the most common means of financing trade, but the underlying trade-related nature of the transaction will often not be known to the banks executing the fund transfer. Banks should refer to the guidance in Title I to manage the risk associated with such transactions. b) Documentary letters of credit (LCs) that have many variations and are suited to a different situation respectively: an LC is a financial instrument issued by a bank that guarantees payment to a named beneficiary (typically an exporter) upon presentation of certain 'complying' documents specified in the credit terms (e.g. evidence that goods have been dispatched). c) Documentary bills for collection (BCs): a BC refers to a process by which payment, or an accepted draft, is collected by a 'collecting' bank from an importer of goods for onward payment to the exporter. The collecting bank gives the relevant trade documentation (which will have been received from the exporter, normally through their bank) to the importer in return.",

            "13.5. Banks should take into account that the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) has developed standards such as the Uniform Customs & Practice for Documentary Credits (600) that is a set of rules which apply to finance institutions which issue Letters of Credit that govern the use of LCs and BCs, but that these do not cover matters related to financial crime.

When assessing the risk profile of a customer or prospective customer that is an NPO for the first time, firms should ensure that they obtain a good understanding of the NPO's governance, how it is funded, its activities, where it operates and who its beneficiaries are. Not all NPOs are exposed in a similar way to ML/TF risk, and firms should take risk-sensitive measures to understand: a) who controls the customer and who its beneficial owners are. As part of this, firms should identify the NPO's trustees or equivalent, its governing body and any other individual who has control or influence over the NPO. For this purpose, firms should refer to information such as the legal status of the NPO, a description of the NPO's governance set-up and/or a list of the legal representative(s). b) how the NPO is funded (private donations, government funds, etc.). For this purpose, firms should refer to information about the donor base, funding sources and fundraising methods, such as annual reports and financial statements. c) what the objectives of the customer's operations are. For this purpose, firms should refer to information such as the customer's mission statement, a list of its programmes and associated budgets, activities, and services delivered. d) which categories of beneficiaries benefit from the customer's activities (for example, refugees, legal entities that receive assistance through the services of the NPO or similar). Documentation gathered for this purpose may include mission statements or campaign- related documents. e) what transactions the NPO is likely to request, based on its objectives and activity profile, including payment of staff or providers posted abroad, and the expected frequency, size, and geographical destination of such transactions. For this purpose, firms should refer to information such as organisational charts, explanations of the organisational structure of the NPO, a list of jurisdictions where the staff is paid and the number of employees to be paid in each of them. f) where the NPO conducts its programmes and/or operations, in particular whether the NPO conducts its activities only at domestic level, or in other jurisdictions associated with higher ML/TF risks and in high-risk third countries. For this purpose, firms should refer to information such as a list of all programmes, activities and services delivered by the NPO, as well as a list of geographical locations served, including its headquarters and operational areas.

When identifying the risk associated with customers that are NPOs, firms should consider at 125 least the following risk factors and assess them on a risk-sensitive basis: Governance and exertion of control a) Does the NPO have a legal status under national law or the national law of another Member State? Is there any documentation that sets out its modalities of governance and identifies the NPO's trustees, members of the governing body or any other individuals who exert control over the NPO? b) Does the legal structure of the NPO require, for its set up, the demonstration of the management capability of its treasurer or managers? c) Does the legal structure of the NPO require the annual disclosure of financial statements? Reputation/adverse media findings d) To what extent is it difficult for firms to establish the good reputation of the NPO and its managers? Is there a good reason why this may be difficult, for example because the NPO has been established only recently, for instance in the last 12 months? e) Has the NPO been linked by relevant, reliable and independent sources to extremism, extremist propaganda or terrorist sympathies and activities? f) Has the NPO been involved in misconduct or criminal activities, including ML/TF-related cases, according to relevant, reliable and independent sources? Funding methods g) Is the NPO's funding transparent and accountable or difficult to trace? Does it publicly document its funding sources and are these subject to external audits? h) Do the NPO's funding methods carry ML/TF risks? Does it rely entirely or largely on cash donations, crypto assets or crowdfunding? Or are the NPO's sources of funds channelled through the payments system? i) Is the NPO funded partly or largely by private donors or donors from jurisdictions associated with higher ML/TF risks or high-risk third countries identified as having strategic deficiencies in their AML/CFT regime? Operations in jurisdictions associated with higher ML/TF risks and high-risk third countries j) Does the NPO operate or deliver assistance in jurisdictions associated with higher ML/TF risks (as assessed based on risk factors presented in Title I of these guidelines) or in high- risk third countries (as identified by the Commission pursuant to Article 9(2) of Directive (EU) 2015/849) or in conflict zones? 126 k) In such situations, does the NPO rely on third parties or intermediaries to perform its activities and is it able to explain the nature of the discharge? In this context, is the NPO able to monitor and have adequate oversight of the discharge by these third parties? l) Is the business relationship with the NPO likely to involve the execution of transactions with a respondent institution located in jurisdictions associated with higher ML/TF risks or in high-risk third countries?",
            "3. Firms should also consider at least the following factors that may contribute to reducing risks: a) The roles and responsibilities of the NPO's governing body and its managers are clearly documented. b) The NPO is legally required to annually disclose its financial statements or to issue an annual report that identifies the sources of funds, the main purpose of the NPO's activities and the categories of beneficiaries of its programmes. c) The NPO can demonstrate it is or has been subject to independent reviews or external audits. d) The NPO has a good public reputation according to relevant, reliable and independent sources. e) The NPO receives fundings from governments, supranational or international organisations that are not associated with high-risk third countries or with jurisdictions with higher ML/TF risks, and the source of its funds can be clearly established. f) The NPO does not have any links with high-risk third countries, or if it has, the NPO can demonstrate that it has taken appropriate steps to mitigate the ML/TF risks (for instance, with the designation of staff responsible for AML/CFT compliance or the design of procedures to identify the NPO's categories of beneficiaries and assess the ML/TF risks associated therewith). g) The NPO's activities and beneficiaries do not expose it to higher ML/TF risks. h) The NPO only delivers assistance and support to individuals through direct material help, such as providing IT equipment or medical devices.",
            "4. In the event the NPO is conducting activities in jurisdictions subject to EU or UN sanctions, firms should establish whether the NPO benefits from any provisions related to humanitarian aid and derogations in EU/UN financial sanctions regimes, such as humanitarian exemptions or derogations. When deciding how to service these customers and in accordance with their own asset freezing obligations, firms should obtain evidence that provide reasonable assurance that the NPO conducts its activities in these jurisdictions in line with the exemptions provided in the regime, or that it benefits from a derogation granted by a relevant competent authority. 127",
            "5. For initial screening purposes and throughout the business relationship once it is established, firms should take the steps necessary to understand how the NPO operates and conducts its operations. Firms that are likely to have NPO customers, for example because they provide money transfer services or current account services, should consider establishing a dedicated contact point for this specific category of customers to have a good understanding of the way the sector is set up and operates. 128"

It also provides that credit or financial institutions that have a management body identify the member of the management body who is ultimately responsible for the implementation of the law, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with AML/CFT requirements. It does not set out in detail how these provisions should be applied.",
            "2. Through these guidelines, the EBA will create a common understanding, by competent authorities and credit or financial institutions, of credit or financial institutions' AML/CFT governance arrangements. A common understanding, which is applied consistently and enforced as necessary, is key to strengthening the EU's AML/CFT defences.",
            "3. These guidelines set clear expectations of the role, tasks and responsibilities of the AML/CFT compliance officer and the management body. They specify that credit or financial institutions should appoint one member of their management body who will ultimately be responsible for the implementation of the AML/CFT obligations, and clarify the tasks and functions of that person. They also describe the roles and responsibilities of the AML/CFT compliance officer, when this person is appointed by the management body pursuant to the proportionality criteria. When the credit or financial institution is part of a group, the guidelines prescribe that a group AML/CFT compliance officer should be appointed and clarify this person's tasks and responsibilities.",
            "4. These guidelines apply to all existing management body structures and do not advocate any particular structure. They complement, but do not replace, relevant guidelines issued by the European Supervisory Authorities on wider governance arrangements and suitability checks. Next steps The guidelines will be translated into the official EU languages and published on the EBA website. The deadline for competent authorities to report whether they comply with the guidelines will be two months after the publication of the translations. The guidelines will apply from 1 December 2022. 3 FINAL REPORT AND GUIDELINES ON THE ROLE OF THE AML/CFT COMPLIANCE OFFICER EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Background and rationale Background",
            "5. Directive (EU) 2015/849 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing requires that credit or financial institutions have in place policies, controls and procedures to mitigate and manage effectively the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF). In accordance with Article 8(4) of this Directive, where appropriate with regard to the size and nature of the business, credit or financial institutions have to appoint a compliance officer at the management level. Article 46(4) further provides that credit or financial institutions that have a management body also identify the member of the management body who is ultimately responsible for the implementation of the law, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with AML/CFT requirements.",
            "6. These provisions complement requirements in other sectoral laws that relate to credit or financial institutions' governance and risk management systems, and suitability requirements for senior function holders.",
            "7. In 2017, in its Supranational Risk Assessment, the European Commission asked the ESAs to develop guidance to clarify the role of AML/CFT compliance officers in credit or financial institutions. At the time, the ESAs considered that existing guidelines on internal governance were sufficient to fulfil the Commission's request.",
            "8. There have, however, been a number of reports that suggest that the requirements set out in Directive (EU) 2015/849 have been implemented unevenly across different sectors and Member States, and that they are not always applied effectively. This can have adverse consequences for the integrity of the EU's financial system.",
            "9. For example, a) In their 2017 Joint Opinion on the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing affecting the Union's financial sector1, the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) considered that the Union's financial sector was exposed to money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risks arising from ineffective AML/CFT systems and controls. Findings from national supervisors pointed to a number of causes for these shortcomings. These included senior management of some credit or financial institutions affording low priority to AML/CFT issues, in particular when paired with a corporate culture that pursues profits at the expense of robust compliance. This lack of senior management buy-in meant that ensuring adequate resources and hiring suitably qualified staff for AML/CFT roles were not seen as a priority, which appeared to affect the quality of financial institutions' AML/CFT controls. 1 JC/2017/07 of 20 February 2017 4 FINAL REPORT AND GUIDELINES ON THE ROLE OF THE AML/CFT COMPLIANCE OFFICER EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY b) The 2019 Report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the assessment of recent alleged money laundering cases involving EU credit institutions2 found that many credit institutions in the Commission's sample had not established adequate risk management systems and controls. The analysis revealed deficiencies in credit institutions' anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism-related governance arrangements (including the 'three lines of defence'), their internal reporting, group policies and senior managements' responsibilities and accountability. c) The EBA found in its 2019/2020 AML/CFT reviews of competent authorities' approaches to the AML/CFT supervision of banks3 that AML/CFT supervisors in some Member States did not interact with financial institutions' senior management because there was no legal or regulatory requirement in those Member States to appoint an AML/CFT compliance officer at a level that was sufficiently senior to report to the financial institution's senior management body. As a result, in those Member States there was a risk that AML/CFT supervision may not be effective. d) The EBA noted in its 2021 Opinion on the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing affecting the European Union's financial sector4 that there was still a sizeable proportion of competent authorities that considered that the quality of some controls had remained poor and many competent authorities identified persisting deficiencies in some key controls. Rationale",
            "10.The EBA has a legal duty to prevent the use of the EU's financial system for ML/TF purposes, and a mandate to lead, monitor and coordinate the EU financial sector's fight against ML/TF. Through these guidelines, the EBA aims to achieve a common understanding, by competent authorities and credit or financial institutions, of the role and responsibilities of a. the AML/CFT compliance officer; and b. the management body with regard to AML/CFT or the senior manager where no management body exists.",
            "11.A common understanding of the role and responsibilities of AML/CFT compliance officers and the management body or senior manager, which is applied and enforced consistently, is important to ensure that credit or financial institutions in all Member States implement sound and effective AML/CFT systems and controls and to protect the EU's financial sector from financial crime.

The European Banking Authority (EBA) has previously outlined its programme on the review of the IRB approach in the EBA's report and opinion on the implementation of the regulatory review of the IRB approach published in February 2016.1 After (i) reviewing supervisory practices, (ii) harmonising the definition of default and (iii) providing more clarity on how to model probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and defaulted exposures, including the estimation of downturn LGD, the credit risk mitigation (CRM) framework constitutes the fourth and last phase of this programme. Although these guidelines (GL) were not originally envisaged as part of the review, the need for these GL has been identified in the course of work aiming to clarify the CRM framework in the context of the advanced IRB (A-IRB) approach.2 They thereby complement the EBA's report on the credit risk mitigation framework3 (the CRM report), which was focused on the standardised approach (SA) and the foundation IRB (F-IRB) approach.",

In accordance with Article 108 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (the Capital Requirements Regulation, CRR), for exposures to which an institution applies the SA or F-IRB approach, the institution may use CRM in accordance with Part Three, Title II, Chapter 4 of the CRR (Chapter 4) in the calculation of risk-weighted exposure amounts (RWEAs). For exposures to which an institution applies the IRB approach with own estimates of LGDs and conversion factors, i.e. exposures under the A-IRB approach, the institution may use CRM in accordance with Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3 of the CRR (Chapter 3). Due to these different requirements for the SA and F-IRB approach on the one hand and for the A-IRB approach on the other hand, the requirements for the use of CRM have to be considered separately."

            "3. Increased clarity of the CRM framework is considered an integral part of the IRB review and reflects the feedback received from the stakeholders to the discussion paper on 'The future of the IRB approach' published in March 20154. One of the main takeaways from the consultation was that, while the EBA had been given mandates to develop technical standards on selected issues,5 there was an overall need to consider the functioning of the CRM framework as a whole. More specifically, the industry flagged the complexity of the current CRR provisions due to numerous references and cross-references that make it difficult to understand which provisions apply under which approach to credit risk.",
            "4. In the case of the A-IRB approach, some clarifications on the use of CRM have already been provided as part of the guidance for the LGD estimation in the EBA Guidelines on PD estimation, LGD estimation and the treatment of defaulted exposures (EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation) published in November 2017.6 However, there are still certain outstanding issues, which have not been addressed and where different interpretations and practices are observed.",
            "5. At the same time, the recent changes introduced through the final Basel III framework7 should also be taken into account to the extent possible. Indeed, in May 2018 the EBA received from the European Commission a call for advice (CfA) on the impact and implementation of the final Basel III framework. The revisions in the scope of the CfA include the revised standards in the areas of credit risk and, in particular, on some specific aspects of the CRM framework. In this context, any issues that may lead to inconsistencies with the current CRR rules or to a deviation from the final Basel III framework have been addressed in the EBA's response to the CfA8 (CFA report) and are therefore not included in these GL.",
            "6. With a view to supporting implementation of the legislation that is clear and consistent across institutions and jurisdictions, these GL therefore clarify the application of current CRR provisions regarding CRM under the A-IRB approach and should help eliminate the unwarranted differences in approaches remaining in the area of CRM due to either different supervisory practices or institution-specific choices.",
            "7. These GL are structured in three main parts: (i) Section 4, with general provisions, which aims to provide clarity on the scope of application of the CRM provisions of Chapter 3; (ii) Section 5, providing guidance on eligibility requirements for both funded credit protection (FCP) and unfunded credit protection (UFCP); and (iii) Section 6, on the treatment of FCP and UFCP."

            "8. This section focuses on carrying out a mapping of the articles in Chapter 3 detailing the provisions for the eligibility and methods of CRM at institutions' disposal for exposures under the A-IRB approach. The aim of this mapping is to shed light on the CRM framework as provided in the CRR, as stakeholders have raised concerns regarding the clarity of the framework as it currently stands. Figure 1: CRM techniques and methods under Chapter 3 of the CRR CRM techniques Funded credit protection (FCP) Unfunded credit protection (UFCP) Through exposure value for master netting agreement (MNA) and on-balance sheet netting (OBSN): Through LGD adjustments for FCP other than MNA and OBSN : Through PD and/or LGD adjustments in accordance with Articles 160(5), 163(4), 161(3), 164(2) and 183(1)-(3) of the CRR Through 'double default' formula in accordance with Articles 153(3) and 154(2) of the CRR in accordance with Articles 166(2)-(3) and Chapter 4 of the CRR in accordance with Articles 181(1)(c)-(g) of the CRR",
            "9. As mentioned above, the scope of application of the CRM framework is defined in Article 108 of the CRR. In particular, for exposures to which an institution applies the SA and F-IRB approach the CRM techniques may be recognised in accordance with Chapter 4, whereas for exposures to which an institution applies the A-IRB approach the CRM techniques may be recognised in accordance with Chapter 3. In this respect, the GL clarify that the requirements of Chapter 4 apply to exposures treated under the A-IRB approach only where explicitly cross-referenced in Chapter 3. Therefore, Chapter 3 applies to exposures under the A-IRB approach and, in particular (as also clarified in Figure 1): · Article 166(2) and (3) of the CRR state that institutions may recognise the effects of master netting agreements (MNA) and on-balance sheet netting (OBSN) respectively through modifications of the exposure value; in this respect, these GL clarify that the CRM effects of such techniques may be recognised only through adjustment of the exposure value subject to all the requirements of Chapter 4, including eligibility requirements and methods. · Article 181(1)(c)-(g) of the CRR state that institutions may recognise the effects of FCP other than MNA and OBSN only in their LGD estimates; in this context, it is clarified that, for the purposes of estimating LGD according to Article 181(1)(c)-(g) of the CRR, the references to 'collateral' should be understood as references to FCP other than MNA and OBSN. As MNA and OBSN are already recognised in the exposure value in accordance with Article 166(2) and (3) of the CRR, their effect should not be recognised again through LGD and hence they are also considered out of the scope of application of Article 181(1) of the CRR on own 6 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT RISK MITIGATION EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY estimates of LGDs. Requirements of Article 181(1)(c)-(g) of the CRR are also not applicable to UFCP, as these are governed separately in Article 183 of the CRR. . While the term 'collateral' is not defined in the CRR, the definitions of FCP and UFCP are provided in Article 4(1)(58) and (59) of the CRR. According to the definitions provided, the fundamental difference between the two types of credit protection lies in the type of risk the protection receiver is exposed to: in the case of FCP, the lending institution bears the risk that the collateral received deteriorates in value, thereby resulting in a lower level of protection, while, in the case of UFCP, the lending institution bears the risk that the protection provider is not able to pay upon default of the obligor. For this reason separate requirements have been specified regarding the recognition of these two different types of credit protection. . The method for the recognition of UFCP by institutions using the A-IRB approach has been specified in Article 160(5) and Article 161(3) of the CRR for non-retail exposures and in Article 163(4) and Article 164(2) of the CRR for retail exposures. These articles clarify that UFCP may be recognised by adjusting PD or LGD estimates in accordance with Article 183(2) and (3) of the CRR and under the constraint that the resulting adjusted risk weight should not be lower than the risk weight that the institution would assign to a comparable direct exposure to the guarantor9 (the risk weight floor). Alternatively, where the requirements under Articles 202 and 217 of the CRR are met, institutions may recognise the effects of UFCP in accordance with Article 153(3) and Article 154(2) of the CRR, the 'double default' formula (applicable to exposures under both the F-IRB and A-IRB approaches). In this respect, Article 161(4) and Article 164(3) of the CRR provide clarifications on the LGD to be used in the double default formula provided by Article 153(3) of the CRR. Finally, it is clarified that the recognition of UFCP in accordance with Article 160(4) and Article 161(1)(c) of the CRR is applicable only where institutions use the F-IRB approach and are therefore out of the scope of these GL.",
            "10. An additional clarification relates to treatment of credit insurance. In particular, focusing on the economic substance of the financial agreement, in accordance with paragraph 36 of the CRM report and Q&A 2014_768,10 it is clarified that, in the context of the A-IRB approach, credit insurance may be recognised as a guarantee (or a credit derivative) where it effectively functions in an equivalent manner. Since the CRR does not give a definition of guarantees or credit derivatives, it is furthermore clarified that in order to consider credit insurance equivalent to UFCP, and therefore as requiring the same eligibility and adjustment criteria for UFCP as included in Article 183(1)-(3) of the CRR, the credit insurance has to meet the UFCP definition given in Article 4(1)(59) of the CRR. In particular, which specific point of Article 183"

            "11.Regarding the scope of application of these GL, it is moreover clarified that it does not include potential support from third parties to the obligor, which can be reflected in accordance with paragraphs 62 to 64 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation, as it does not constitute a CRM technique. Therefore, the treatment of rating of third parties is not considered a method for recognising CRM. In particular, the rating transfer of paragraph 62(a) of those guidelines, i.e. the reference to 'appropriate guarantee', reflects support provided by the third party to the obligor and not to the institution itself, as would be the case under the definition of UFCP as a form of CRM technique given in points (57) and (59) of Article 4(1) of the CRR.",
            "12.It should be noted in this context that providing support by a third party to the obligor does not require any action from the lending institution and if it is efficient it may decrease the PD of the obligor. In contrast, CRM is a protection provided for the lending institution and, in accordance with Article 178(1) of the CRR, as further clarified in the EBA Guidelines on the application of the definition of default, the use of CRM is an indication of default of the obligor."

For exposures to which institutions apply the A-IRB approach, the CRR specifies the eligibility requirements for (i) FCP (other than MNA and OBSN) in Article 181(1)(f) and (ii) UFCP in Article 183(1). In accordance with these provisions the A-IRB institutions are required to ensure that the CRM meets the fundamental elements of the eligibility criteria, while at the same time the hierarchy of the approaches is maintained by allowing a broader range of CRM techniques to be recognised under the A-IRB approach than under the less sophisticated approaches. Under the SA and F-IRB approach, the eligibility requirements of Chapter 4 are very restrictive considering the limitations of the methods for the recognition of CRM. Under the A-IRB approach, the risk sensitivity is enhanced through broader eligibility of CRM techniques provided that institutions can adequately reflect their effects in the LGD estimates."

            "14. With regard to FCP (other than OBSN and MNA), Article 181(1)(f) of the CRR establishes that, if collateral is taken into account in the LGD estimation, institutions should set internal requirements for collateral management, legal certainty and risk management that are 'generally consistent with those set out in Chapter 4, Section 3'. The lack of guidance on the concept of general consistency is an issue that has been highlighted by the industry as being a source of uncertainty and variability in the application of the CRR provisions with respect to CRM for exposures treated under the A-IRB approach (A-IRB exposures). Some clarification has already been provided in Article 55 of the Final draft regulatory technical standards on the specification of the assessment methodology for competent authorities regarding compliance of an institution with the requirements to use the IRB Approach in accordance with 8 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT RISK MITIGATION EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Articles 144(2), 173(3) and 180(3)(b) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (RTS on AM),11 which specifies that, for the purposes of Article 181(1)(f) of the CRR, general consistency should be understood as, or would be fulfilled by, full consistency with the requirements for collateral valuation and legal certainty. In other words, if the institution's policies are fully consistent with those specified in Chapter 4, Section 3, for collateral valuation and legal certainty, this ensures that they meet the general consistency requirement of Article 181(1)(f) of the CRR.",
            "15. Moreover, an implication of Article 181(1)(f) of the CRR is that institutions should provide appropriate internal requirements for collateral management, legal certainty and risk management for any collateral agreement taken into account in the LGD estimation and not only for those types of collateral that are listed in Chapter 4, Section 3.",
            "16. These GL therefore provide the following two clarifications: . General eligibility principles on legal certainty and collateral valuation should apply to all collaterals used for the purposes of LGD estimation. In other words, these principles form a minimum set of eligibility requirements that is meant to ensure that all collateral types, even those that are not explicitly included in any of the broad categories described in Chapter 4, Section 3, are subject to the assessment of legal certainty and collateral valuation. In particular: i. In terms of general principles on legal certainty applicable to all collateral used in LGD estimation, institutions should establish internal requirements that ensure that the collateral agreement is legally effective and enforceable, i.e. ensuring the power of the creditor to enforce the realisation of the collateral. Institutions should have the right to liquidate or take legal possession of the collateral even in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of the obligor and, where applicable, of the custodian holding the collateral (i.e. where the bankruptcy or insolvency of the custodian coincides with the default of the obligor). The enforced liquidation or repossession of collateral should be possible in a 'reasonable timeframe (in line with Article 210(a))' considering the market and legal environment in a relevant jurisdiction. ii. In terms of general principles on collateral valuation applicable to all types of collateral used in the LGD estimation, institutions should specify in their internal policies the rules governing the revaluation of the collateral, including methods and frequency of monitoring of the value of the collateral, which should be consistent with the type of collateral, taking into account the volatility of the value. Moreover, more frequent monitoring should be carried out where the market is subject to significant changes in conditions. . A mapping of Chapter 4, Section 3, to legal certainty and collateral valuation is tailor-made for a subset of broad categories of collateral, i.e. the minimum criteria that the A-IRB"

The GL provide principles for institutions on how to achieve a sufficient level of legal certainty while avoiding excessive burden and unjustified costs. In particular, the GL specify a minimum list of jurisdictions that should be considered relevant for a given physical collateral other than immovable property, and for which the legal opinion should be provided.

The list of jurisdictions that should be considered relevant includes the jurisdiction where it is most likely that the realisation of the collateral would be carried out, should this be necessary. While in some cases it may not be easy to foresee the place of realisation of collateral, the choice of this most likely jurisdiction could be based on one of the following considerations: · contractual specification of the location to which the obligor is obliged to move the collateral in the event of non-payment; · legal obligation of the obligor to move the collateral to a location specified by the creditor, stemming from international regulations or conventions; · previous experience with regard to realising collateral of the same type; . in cases such as leasing exposures, where the asset is owned by the institution, the most likely choice of the institution. In some cases, it may be difficult to specify just one jurisdiction where the potential realisation of collateral would take place. In such case, where there are two or more jurisdictions where the realisation of collateral is equally likely, institutions should include jurisdictions considered relevant, as specified in paragraph 23(e) of the GL.",
            "21.It should be noted that the GL do not require a separate legal opinion for each relevant jurisdiction. Where possible, institutions may rely on a single legal opinion covering several jurisdictions. This may be possible in particular in those cases where international regulations have been adopted that provide a robust international framework enforcing creditors' rights over their collateral. Such regulations would typically have a form of an international convention that has been adopted or confirmed by a number of jurisdictions. The assessment based on 11 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT RISK MITIGATION EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY international regulations should therefore include a clear identification of whether these regulations cover all jurisdictions relevant for a given collateral and an assessment of whether they ensure legal effectiveness and enforceability of the collateral, as well as the types of collateral that are subject to the regulations."

It should be noted that, whereas institutions are required to collect information about the cash flows and allocate them to the specific collateral in accordance with paragraph 114 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation, this should not constitute a constraint on the institutions' design of LGD models, which are not required to be based on components such as secured LGD and unsecured LGD.",
            "27. Article 166(2) and (3) of the CRR clarifies that the effects of MNA and OBSN should be recognised in the exposure value in accordance with Chapter 4. For MNA this implies that institutions may use the supervisory volatility adjustments approach or the own estimates volatility adjustments approach in Article 220 of the CRR or, subject to the permission of the competent authority, the internal model approach in Article 221 of the CRR in order to calculate the fully adjusted exposure value (E*) to be used for the purposes of RWEA and expected loss (EL) calculation. For OBSN, as clarified in the GL, institutions may also calculate the E* to be used for the purposes of RWEA and EL calculation. However, in contrast to the treatment of MNA, for OBSN the E* should be calculated in accordance with Article 223(5) of the CRR. In both cases (MNA and OBSN), the effects of netting are directly recognised in the E* and do not affect the LGD.",
            "28. In this respect, it is important to ensure that, for exposures that are covered by either OBSN or MNA, the netting is not double counted and that the associated LGD is estimated properly by institutions. Therefore, for both OBSN and MNA, for the purposes of RWEA calculation the E* obtained in accordance with Chapter 4 is multiplied by the risk weight assigned to the original exposure as if the exposure were not secured by OBSN or MNA. The same exposure value and risk parameters should be used for the calculation of the RWEA and the EL amount. In order to ensure proper estimation of the LGD, the GL clarify how to calculate the numerator and denominator of the realised LGD for exposures that are covered by netting arrangements. In particular: . in order to keep consistency between the exposure value used for the calculation of the realised LGD and the adjusted exposure value used for the computation of RWEA, both the economic loss (i.e. the numerator of the realised LGD) and the amount outstanding at default used as denominator of the realised LGD should be computed according to the 13 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT RISK MITIGATION EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY adjusted exposure value but, in accordance with paragraph 131 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation, should include any amount of principal, interest or fee realised so far; . since the starting point of the economic loss is an adjusted exposure value that already reflects the netting effects, no cash flows from netting should be included as recoveries in the calculation of the economic loss.",
            "29. The following example presents the treatment applicable for both OBSN and MNA: · An institution has an exposure of 100 to a retail client, which is secured by a netting agreement with a deposit of 30 from this retail client (no maturity mismatch). · The PD assigned to this client is 0.5%. . The LGD estimate for this exposure is 75%. The LGD estimate is based on realised LGDs of past exposures: a similar exposure had a gross exposure value (E) of 50 and an E* of 20. Discounted cash flows from recoveries (excluding netting cash flows) were 5. The realised LGD is thus 20-2 = 75%. 20-5 20 For the calculation of the RWEA and EL amount, the institution should use 70 (E*) as the exposure value. The PD and LGD for calculating the risk weight should not contain any cash flows from the deposit of 30. Therefore, for the exposure in the example, institutions should calculate RWEA and EL amount in the following manner: RWEA = 70 · RWformula(PD = 0.5%; LGD = 75%) EL amount = 70 . 0.5% . 75%. The cash flows from the deposit of 30 used for netting are considered neither in the LGD estimate nor in the realised LGD.",
            "30. Finally, additional guidance is provided in order to ensure that the criteria specified by institutions for adjusting LGD are consistent with Article 181(1) of the CRR. In particular the following aspects are pointed out: . In accordance with Article 181(1)(c) of the CRR, in cases where there is a significant degree of dependence between the risk of the obligor and the risk of the collateral, such dependence should be addressed by institutions in a conservative manner. When the collateral provided by the obligor corresponds to one of its own liabilities (e.g. obligor's own bonds or equity) that ranks lower than or pari passu with the obligation of the obligor that they collateralise, in terms of seniority of the claim, this dependence is full. If the obligation is secured by the obligor's own equity, the dependence is always full. Therefore, consistently with the fact that such liabilities are residual claims with respect to the main obligation, the GL clarify that such collateral should not lead to any reduction in the institutions' LGD estimates. As an example, where an institution invests in a corporate bond that is 14 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT RISK MITIGATION EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY collateralised by the institution's own equity, the presence of such collateral should not reduce the LGD that the institution would assign to the uncollateralised corporate bond. . For other than first rank claims, institutions should ensure that the valuation carried out is sufficiently risk sensitive to properly reflect the effects on LGD of the subordinated position of the institution in relation to the collateral. . For other physical collateral, especially where the collateral is likely to move between jurisdictions during the lifetime of the loan, institutions should consider whether the potential location of the collateral at the moment when there is a need to realise it could influence the institutions' ability to expeditiously gain control over it. If uncertainty exists with regard to the ability to gain control over the collateral to the length of time it might take to realise it, such uncertainty should be reflected appropriately in the LGD estimates."

            "31. This section aims to outline the scope of methodologies that can be used for the purposes of recognising the effects of UFCP under the A-IRB approach. In particular, as clarified in the GL and also shown in Figure 2, three options are envisaged in the CRR: · In accordance with Article 160(5), Article 161(3) and Article 164(2) of the CRR, institutions may adjust PD or LGD estimates based on the criteria specified by institutions. In particular, Article 183(2) and (3) of the CRR specifies how institutions may adjust their risk parameters in order to recognise the effects of guarantees and credit derivatives. In this context, without prejudice to the constraint that the resulting adjusted risk weight should not be lower than the risk weight floor, the GL clarify that institutions have three alternative approaches in order to perform such adjustments: i. The modelling approach. This reflects the effects of the UFCP by estimating new risk parameters and, in particular, by considering the UFCP in the estimation of LGD, and in some cases also in the estimation of PD. ii. The substitution of risk parameters approach. This is understood as an extreme adjustment of PD and LGD, in which both the PD and LGD of the obligor are substituted with the PD and LGD that the institution would assign to comparable direct exposures to the guarantor whose direct exposures are treated under the A- IRB or F-IRB approach (A-IRB guarantor and F-IRB guarantor respectively). iii. The override. In accordance with Article 172(3) of the CRR and Section 8.2 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation, if there are individual and exceptional circumstances related to a given UFCP that the model cannot reasonably take into account, institutions have the option of adjusting risk parameters in the application of the model, through overrides in the grade assignment process. 15 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT RISK MITIGATION EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY . In the case of guarantors whose direct exposures are treated under the SA (SA guarantors), in accordance with Article 183(4) of the CRR, institutions may recognise the UFCP in accordance with the requirements (eligibility criteria and methods) of Chapter 4 and therefore by applying the SA risk weight that the institutions would assign to comparable direct exposures to the guarantor (the substitution of risk weight approach). . Finally, UFCP may be recognised via the treatment proposed under Article 153(3), Article 154(2), Article 161(4) and Article 164(3) of the CRR (the double default treatment) provided that the requirements under Articles 202 and 217 of the CRR are met. Institutions' policies and criteria",
            "32. Having clarified the methods and approaches to recognise CRM in the institutions' risk parameters, it is important to ensure that institutions cannot choose arbitrarily among these approaches in order to reduce capital requirements. In this respect, rather than requiring institutions to use one of the specific methodologies described above, the GL clarify that institutions should have policies for assessing and recognising the effects of UFCP that are clear, consistent with their risk management practices and applied by institutions consistently over time and for a specific type of exposures. This means, for instance, that the substitution of risk parameters approach may be applied for the type of guaranteed exposures in which the collection and recovery processes assume these guarantees to be the first and main source of recovery. These policies should include a clear specification of the scope of application of each specific method/approach described above, i.e. for each rating system institutions should specify which approach applies. Consistency in the application of the methods for the recognition of UFCP is important in order to reduce arbitrage opportunities.",
            "33. Moreover, in order to ensure appropriate LGD estimation it was considered necessary to specify the treatment of ineligible UFCP. Similarly to the case of ineligible collateral, the inclusion of cash flows from ineligible UFCP in the calculation of realised LGD could potentially bias the unsecured LGD, if not monitored properly. It is therefore proposed to align the treatment of cash flows from ineligible UFCP to the treatment of cash flows from ineligible collateral as specified in paragraph 127 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation. In particular, as clarified in the GL, if the UFCP is ineligible, it should not be recognised using any of the methods specified above. Moreover, for the purposes of LGD estimation the cash flows received from ineligible UFCP should be treated as if they had been received without the use of UFCP, i.e. as if they were unsecured. However, institutions should in any case collect the information on these cash flows, monitor their levels and where necessary perform appropriate adjustments to avoid any bias in the LGD estimates. 16 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT RISK MITIGATION EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Figure 2: Alternative approaches to recognise the effects of UFCP Substitution of risk parameters approach: Eligibility requirements of Chapter 4 Negligibility of costs to enforce UFCP F-IRB guarantor: substitute PD and regulatory LGD of direct comparable exposures to the guarantor Non-defaulting status of the guarantor Covered part of the exposure assigned to a separate scope of application of the LGD model A-IRB guarantor: substitute PD and LGD of direct comparable exposures to the guarantor SA guarantor Adjustment of PD and/or LGD in accordance with Article 183(1)-(3) and subject to the risk weight floor of Articles 161(3) and 164(2) CRR Modelling approach: Eligibility requirements of Article 183(1) CRR Adjust LGD only or PD and LGD under certain conditions using UFCP in model development F-IRB guarantor Treatment of UFCP Substitution of risk weight approach: A-IRB guarantor for SA guarantor in accordance with Article 183(4) and Chapter 4 CRR Override Eligibility requirements of Article 183(1) CRR Double default treatment: Article 153(3) CRR Adjust LGD only or PD and LGD under certain conditions in the application of risk parameters In the scope of the final Basel III framework In the scope of these Guidelines 17 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT RISK MITIGATION EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Modelling approach",
            "34. The GL also clarify that where institutions adopt the modelling approach to assess and recognise the effects of UFCP they should consider and take into account, if relevant, in their LGD estimates in a conservative manner the following elements: · potential currency mismatches between the underlying obligation and the UFCP; this is to ensure consistency with the requirement of Article 181(1)(d) of the CRR in the case of FCP; . the correlation between the guarantor's ability and willingness to perform under the obligation and the obligor's ability to repay; this is to ensure consistency with Article 181(1)(c) of the CRR in the case of FCP; . the defaulted status of the guarantor and its resulting reduced ability to repay; in particular, in case there are limited data for modelling the effect of a defaulted guarantor, an appropriate level of conservatism has to be reflected either through margin of conservatism in the estimation or through additional conservatism in the application of risk parameters.",
            "35. The GL clarify that, in adopting the modelling approach, institutions may adjust either the LGD only or both PD and LGD. Moreover, it is clarified that the simultaneous adjustment of PD and LGD should be limited to those cases where the adjustment of only the LGD does not fully reflect the effects of the UFCP and so the adjustment of the PD does not lead to double counting. The adjustment of only the PD parameters is not allowed in any circumstances, as this would be inconsistent with the requirement of Article 178 of the CRR that the need of the institution to realise any collateral or UFCP indicates default of the obligor (this applies also in cases where the guarantor takes over the original schedule of payments from the obligor). Based on this principle, any observations from past realisations of UFCP should be reflected in the estimation of LGD, and not PD, of the obligor. The UFCP may also have an effect on the PD of the obligor only if institutions can provide empirical evidence that the existence of the UFCP influences the behaviour of the obligor in such a way that the obligor is more likely to pay its obligations on time.",
            "36. Bearing in mind that the recognition of CRM effects under the A-IRB approach is ruled by Chapter 3 of Part Three, Title II, of the CRR, an important clarification included in the GL is that the adjustments of the LGD estimates should be performed based on historical experience (i.e. cash flows received from guarantors and costs associated with the realisation of the UFCP). According to Article 179(1)(a) of the CRR, LGD estimates should not be based purely on judgemental considerations. Therefore, institutions are not allowed to use pure theoretical models for the purposes of recognising the effects of UFCP in their risk parameters. That said, if historical experience and empirical evidence are the main driver of the adjustments of the grades, pools or LGD estimates, human judgement is also important in ensuring the appropriateness of the models and assumptions, as specified in Section 4.3 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation. Any theoretical assumptions used should be adequately calibrated and back-tested by the institutions. 18 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT RISK MITIGATION EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Substitution of risk parameters approach",
            "37. The substitution of risk parameters approach is understood for A-IRB exposures as an extreme adjustment of the PD and LGD of the original exposure that implies the treatment of a guaranteed exposure as if it were a direct exposure to the guarantor. In order to ensure consistency with the application of the same approach to exposures that are treated under the F-IRB approach, the GL clarify that, for the purposes of applying the substitution of risk parameters approach, the UFCP should be eligible in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 4. Moreover, two additional conditions for the use of the substitution of risk parameters approach are envisaged. The first additional condition is that the costs of exercising the UFCP should be expected to be negligible compared with the amount of the credit protection provided. Otherwise, it would be more prudent to reflect the effects of such UFCP and related costs through adjustment of the LGD estimates via the modelling approach. The second additional condition is that the guarantor is in a non-defaulted status. In this respect it is important to clarify that, in the event of default of the guarantor during the lifetime of the loan, institutions applying the substitution of risk parameters approach should treat the exposure as unsecured (i.e. not covered by this UFCP). It is considered inappropriate to use risk parameters of a defaulted guarantor for an exposure to a performing obligor. Furthermore, as the rating system is subject to the substitution of risk parameters approach, institutions would not be able to reflect the effect of such guarantee in the LGD of the obligor. It can be noted that, under the modelling approach too, such cases should be treated with caution, as it is expected that limited data are available to support the estimates where both obligor and guarantor default.",
            "38. A number of specific clarifications are provided for the application of both the substitution of risk parameters approach and the substitution of risk weight approach. In particular: . Institutions should continue to collect and store information related to the classification and performance of the obligor and the exposure (i.e. all data relevant to PD and LGD estimation) and use this information in the estimation of the PD of the obligor. This aspect has also been clarified in Chapter 5 of the EBA GL on PD and LGD estimation. This is to ensure that institutions use all relevant information and all available default observations in the estimation of the PD of the obligor. . Institutions should consider the nature of the obligor for internal risk management purposes, recognising the different nature and, therefore, separately assessing direct and indirect exposures towards the guarantors. Given that the exposures guaranteed by certain entities may have significantly different risk profiles from direct exposures to such entities, institutions should be able to analyse these different risk profiles and, if necessary, adapt their credit policies. Institutions should also be able to analyse whether the processes of collecting the payments are similarly efficient in cases of direct and indirect exposures and hence they should be able to assess whether the use of the substitution approach is appropriate 19 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT RISK MITIGATION EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY · Institutions should define ex ante a separate scope of application of the LGD model and calculate separately the risk weight for the type of guaranteed exposures or part of exposures that will be treated in accordance with the substitution of risk parameters approach or the substitution of risk weight approach and that will therefore be assigned to the PD and LGD of a comparable direct exposure to the guarantor or the risk weight of the guarantor respectively. This is supported by the fact that institutions are treating the part of the exposure that is covered by the UFCP as a direct exposure towards the guarantor for risk management purposes. Assigning different PDs to different parts of the exposure (as in the substitution of risk parameters approach, where the guaranteed part receives the PD of the guarantor and the unguaranteed part the PD of the obligor) implies that the calculation of risk weight should be performed separately for the part of the exposure that is covered by the UFCP and also, therefore, the computation of the LGD. This is supported by Article 172(1)(e)(ii) of the CRR, which allows different PDs to be assigned to the parts of exposures covered by a guarantee. The separate calculation of risk weight is a direct consequence of the use of a different PD and is equivalent to using a different risk weight under the substitution of risk weight approach envisaged in Article 183(4) of the CRR for A-IRB exposures covered by UFCP provided by SA guarantor. It is important to note that using a different risk weight for a part of exposure due to the existence of a guarantee is an exception to the general rule that the risk weight should be calculated in accordance with the formula laid out in Articles 153 and 154 of the CRR and taking into consideration the full amount of the exposure. In fact, as also clarified in Q&A 2016_256015 for retail exposures secured by immovable property, in cases of exposures that are partially secured by FCP, institutions should calculate the RWEA in accordance with either Article 153 or Article 154 considering the full exposure. It should be noted that the exception made for exposures that are partially secured by UFCP and to which institutions apply the substitution of risk parameters approach goes in the direction of the treatment proposed for F-IRB exposures covered by a guarantee (Article 236 of the CRR), which is proposed to be an option open to A-IRB institutions in the final Basel III framework published in December 2017. Finally, it is important to note that the exception described above refers only to the use of risk parameters and the calculation of the risk weight and EL.",
            "39. While the PD estimates are relevant to the obligors and hence all observations should be used regardless of the approach used to recognise the UFCP, the LGD estimates are specific to specific types of facilities. The facilities covered by UFCP may be treated as under the scope of a separate LGD model. Therefore, it is clarified that, for such guaranteed exposures under the substitution of risk parameters approach, institutions are not required to estimate the LGD parameters other than the LGDs of comparable direct exposures to the guarantor."

            "57. In particular, as also summarised in Figure 10, for exposures covered by multiple UFCPs that provide protection to the same part of the exposure, following the same rationale as for the case of exposures covered by both FCP and UFCP, the GL propose the following: · If direct exposures to the guarantor are treated under the F-IRB approach, institutions should use the LGD values provided in Article 161(1) of the CRR. . If direct exposures to the guarantor are treated under the A-IRB approach, institutions should try to estimate the LGD of comparable direct exposures to the guarantor including the effects of the other UFCPs. This is presented in the example in Figure 7 and Figure 8, where the LGD of comparable direct exposures to the guarantor providing the UFCP(B) of 40 should include the effects of the overlapping UFCP(A) of 20. If institutions are not able to perform this estimation, the two following alternatives are considered: i. If the LGD of unsecured exposures to the guarantor is lower than or equal to the LGD of unsecured exposures to the obligor, then the institution should use the LGD of the exposure including the effect of the other UFCPs as LGD of a comparable direct exposure to the guarantor. Taking the example in Figure 7 and Figure 8, this implies that, if the LGD of unsecured exposures to guarantor B is not higher than the LGD of unsecured exposures to the original obligor, the institution can use the LGD of the exposure of 40 backed only by the UFCP provided by guarantor A for 20; otherwise, institutions should use the LGD of unsecured exposures to guarantor B. ii. If the LGD of unsecured exposures to the guarantor is greater than the LGD of unsecured exposures to the obligor, or if institutions are not able to perform such comparison, then: . For non-retail guarantors, institutions should use either the LGD values provided in Article 161(1) of the CRR or the LGD applicable to unsecured exposures to the guarantor. Moreover, in order to avoid cherry picking, the GL clarify that this choice should be made consistently for the type of exposures and not at the level of the individual exposure. . For retail guarantors, institutions should use the LGD applicable to unsecured exposures to the guarantor. The option of using regulatory LGD values is not available for retail guarantors, as they are not considered appropriate for the retail exposure class. 30 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT RISK MITIGATION EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Figure 9: How to derive LGD for a comparable direct exposure to the guarantor for A-IRB exposure with FCP and UFCP covering the same part of the exposure What is the approach applicable to direct exposures to the guarantor?

In accordance with Article 108(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, institutions that apply the IRB approach by using their own estimates of LGD in accordance with Article 143(2) of that Regulation may recognise credit risk mitigation in accordance with Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3 of that Regulation. Institutions may recognise credit risk mitigation in accordance with Part Three, Title II, Chapter 4 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 where those requirements are referred to in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 3 of that Regulation and in accordance with these guidelines.",

This includes, in particular, funded credit protection other than master netting agreements and on-balance sheet netting. Credit risk mitigation effects of master netting agreements and on-balance sheet netting are reflected in the exposure value. Therefore, for the types of exposures where institutions have received permission to use own LGD estimates, institutions may recognise funded credit protection in accordance with Article 181(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 only where that protection has not already been recognised in the exposure value for the cases specified in Article 166 of that Regulation and in line with paragraph 13.",

In recognising the effects of on-balance sheet netting and master netting agreements, institutions should take into account all requirements related to these techniques specified in Part Three, Title II, Chapter 4 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, including the eligibility criteria and the methods for recognising the risk mitigation effects of such instruments. 37 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT RISK MITIGATION EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY",

Question 2: Do you agree with the proposed clarifications on the assessment of legal certainty of movable physical collateral? How do you currently perform the assessment of legal effectiveness and enforceability for movable physical collateral? Question 3: Do you agree with the proposed clarification regarding the calculation of realised LGD on exposures covered by eligible on-balance sheet netting or master netting agreements? Question 4: Do you have specific concerns related to the recognition of collateral in the modelling of LGD? How do you currently recognise collateral in your LGD estimates? Question 5: What approaches for the recognition of the unfunded credit protection do you currently use? What challenges would there be in applying approaches listed above for the recognition of unfunded credit protection?

How do you recognise the portfolio guarantees' credit risk mitigation effects in adjusting risk parameters? 63 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT RISK MITIGATION EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Feedback on the public consultation The EBA publicly consulted on the draft proposal contained in this paper. The consultation period lasted for 3 months and ended on 25 May 2019. The EBA received 35 responses, of which 25 were published on the EBA website. This paper presents a summary of the key points and other comments arising from the consultation, the analysis and discussion triggered by these comments and the actions taken to address them if deemed necessary. In many cases, several industry bodies made similar comments or the same comments were repeated in the responses to different questions. In such cases, the comments and EBA analysis are included in the section of this paper where the EBA considers them most appropriate. Changes to the draft guidelines have been incorporated as a result of the responses received during the public consultation. Summary of key issues and the EBA's response As the consultation paper included 12 specific questions, the industry provided detailed feedback on the draft GL. There was general support for the GL and in particular for the EBA's efforts to provide clarity on the CRM framework for A-IRB exposures. While the overall number of responses is high, it has to be noted that most of the submitters did not respond to all of the questions and were focused on specific topics such as legal certainty of other physical collateral and the treatment of credit insurance. Only six respondents provided comprehensive feedback on all or most of the questions. Most of the respondents focused on the eligibility requirements of FCP and the assessment of legal certainty (questions 1 and 2). In particular, negative feedback was received on the strict approach proposed for the selection of relevant jurisdictions for other physical collateral (i.e. the set of jurisdictions where the collateral could move during the lifetime of the loan according to the collateral agreement). The alternative approach considered in an explanatory box (where the relevant set of jurisdictions could be limited to those where the collateral is usually located depending on the purpose of its use) was evaluated as unpractical, since many physical types of collateral such as ships or aircrafts do not have a precise set of usual jurisdictions where they operate. Some of the respondents also pointed out the potential cost of having a legal opinion for each jurisdiction. Furthermore, it was also argued that it is not market practice to require assets to be operated or located within a limited number of jurisdictions. Moreover, the respondents brought to the EBA attention a number of international agreements, such as the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment, the Protocol thereto on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment and the Luxembourg Rail Protocol (expected to be in force by the time the GL come into force), which are supposed to provide a robust international framework for the enforcement of creditors' rights over their collateral. The EBA has carefully considered the 64 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON CREDIT RISK MITIGATION EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY feedback received and adjusted the proposal such that legal certainty could be achieved in a simpler and less costly manner. Several respondents (nine) focused on the treatment of credit insurance, in particular with respect to the final Basel III framework, in which these exposures will be treated under the F-IRB approach. While the comments are mostly in response to questions 6, 8 and 11, they generally appear to go beyond the scope of these GL, contesting the requirements of the CRR and the reforms envisaged with the implementation of the final Basel III framework. A comprehensive response to these concerns was expressed in the EBA's Opinion on the treatment of credit insurance in the prudential framework, published and submitted to the Commission in March 202025. While there was broad agreement with the requirements specified for the back-testing of substitution of risk parameters, some respondents expressed concerns about its legal feasibility. More detailed feedback with regard to these and other comments is provided in the table below."

            "1. Executive Summary Article 84(6) of the Directive 2013/36/EU1 (Capital Requirements Directive - CRD) mandates the EBA to issue Guidelines to specify the criteria for the evaluation by an institution's internal system of the interest rate risk of an institution's non-trading book activities (IRRBB) as well as the criteria for the identification, management and mitigation by institutions of the IRRBB either if it implements internal systems, the standardised approach or the simplified standardised approach. The EBA published in July 2018 Guidelines \"on the management of interest rate risk arising from non-trading book activities\" (\"the 2018 Guidelines\") that apply from June 2019 with dedicated provisions on these aspects. The current Guidelines replace the 2018 EBA Guidelines as some of its parts will be covered by dedicated RTS and the amended mandate includes new aspects as explained below. These new Guidelines maintain continuity with the previous Guidelines as far as possible, while updating some elements. The Guidelines are broadly consistent with the Basel standards with some further elaborated sections following the CRD mandate, particularly on CSRBB assessment and monitoring and non- satisfactory IRRBB internal systems. The EBA is mandated to specify in these Guidelines additional criteria for the assessment and monitoring by institutions of their credit spread risk arising from their non-trading book activities (CSRBB). The Guidelines provide a definition and the scope of application of CSRBB. They contain dedicated sections for CSRBB with specific provisions on the identification, assessment and monitoring of CSRBB. Finally, the mandate requests the inclusion of criteria for determining whether the internal systems implemented by institutions for the purpose of evaluating IRRBB are not satisfactory, in which case a competent authority may require an institution to use the standardised methodology. After some general provisions, the Guidelines contain separate specific chapters for IRRBB and for CSRBB. Next steps The guidelines will be translated into the official EU languages and published on the EBA website. The deadline for competent authorities to report whether they comply with the guidelines will be two months after the publication of the translations. Upon publication of these Guidelines, the 2018 Guidelines are repealed and replaced. Given the importance of this regulatory product at the 1 Directive (EU) 2019/878 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2019 amending Directive 2013/36/EU as regards exempted entities, financial holding companies, mixed financial holding companies, remuneration, supervisory measures and powers and capital conservation measures. 3 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF INTEREST RATE RISK AND CREDIT SPREAD RISK ARISING FROM NON-TRADING BOOK ACTIVITIES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY time of its publication in the current interest rate risk environment, the EBA will continue its continuous dialogue with stakeholders for a close monitoring of the IRRBB aspects. 4 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF INTEREST RATE RISK AND CREDIT SPREAD RISK ARISING FROM NON-TRADING BOOK ACTIVITIES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY",

Paragraph 1 of Article 84 of Directive 2013/36/EU establishes that institutions shall use either internal systems, the standardised methodology or the simplified standardised methodology4 to identify, evaluate, manage and mitigate interest rate risk of an institution's non-trading book activities. Paragraph 3 empowers competent authorities to require an institution the use of the standardised methodology to evaluate that risk where its internal systems for the purposes of such evaluation are not satisfactory.",
            "4. In this context, Directive 2013/36/EU sets out a number of mandates to the EBA, namely: (a) Following point (a) of paragraph 6 of Article 84 of Directive 2013/36/EU, these Guidelines will specify the criteria to evaluate interest rate risk of an institution's non-trading book activities when the institutions implement internal systems.5 In this context Section 4.3 of these Guidelines specify the necessary criteria for the measurement of the risk. (b) For the purposes of paragraph 3 of Article 84 of Directive 2013/36/EU, these Guidelines will specify criteria for the determination of internal systems that are not satisfactory to evaluate interest rate risk of an institution's non-trading book"

In summary, these Guidelines provide the legal framework for institutions' IRRBB internal systems and for the supervisory outlier tests (SOT) calculations if not specified in the relevant Regulatory Technical Standards on SOT. The Guidelines are also applicable, as regards the identification, management and mitigation of IRRBB, in case the internal systems are replaced by the use of the IRRBB standardised methodology (SA), in which case the relevant Regulatory Technical Standards on SA provide the necessary specifications for IRRBB evaluation aspects as well as for the purposes of SOT calculations if not specified in the relevant Regulatory Technical Standards on SOT.6 The Guidelines also provide the legal framework for assessing and monitoring CSRBB.

            "8. The Guidelines are strongly inspired by the 2018 EBA Guidelines on the management of interest rate risk arising from non-trading book activities. As explained in the following paragraphs, these Guidelines generally maintain continuity to the 2018 Guidelines in the identification, management and measurement of IRRBB under internal systems. However, some new elements are introduced like prudent behavioral assumption on non-maturity deposits from non-financial counterparties. The Guidelines also incorporate criteria to identify non-satisfactory IRRBB internal systems and add specific chapters to CSRBB identification, assessment and monitoring.",

Interest rate sensitive instruments Assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet items in the non-trading book, which are sensitive to interest rate changes (excluding assets deducted from CET1 capital - e.g., real estate or intangible assets or equity exposures in the non-trading book). Credit spread sensitive instruments Assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet items in the non-trading book, which are sensitive to credit spread changes (excluding assets deducted from CET1 capital - e.g., real estate or intangible assets or equity exposures in the non-trading book). Gap risk Risk resulting from the term structure of interest rate sensitive instruments that arises from differences in the timing of their rate changes, covering changes to the term structure of interest rates occurring consistently across the yield curve (parallel risk) or differentially by period (non-parallel risk). Basis risk Risk arising from the impact of relative changes in interest rates on interest rate sensitive instruments that have similar tenors but are priced using different interest rate indices. Basis risk arises from the imperfect correlation in the adjustment of the rates earned and paid on different interest rate sensitive instruments with otherwise similar rate change characteristics. Option risk Risk arising from options (embedded and explicit), where the institution or its customer can alter the level and timing of their cash flows, namely the risk arising from interest rate sensitive instruments where the holder will almost certainly exercise the option if it is in their financial interest to do so (embedded or explicit automatic options) and the risk arising from flexibility embedded implicitly or within the terms of interest rate sensitive instruments, such that changes in interest rates may affect a change in the behaviour of the client (embedded behavioural option risk). Credit spread risk from non-trading book activities (CSRBB) Risk driven by changes of the market price for credit risk, for liquidity and for potentially other characteristics of credit-risky instruments, which is not captured by another existing 13 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF INTEREST RATE RISK AND CREDIT SPREAD RISK ARISING FROM NON-TRADING BOOK ACTIVITIES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY prudential framework such as IRRBB or by expected credit/(jump-to-) default risk. CSRBB captures the risk of an instrument's changing spread while assuming the same level of creditworthiness, i.e. how the credit spread is moving within a certain rating/PD range. Net interest income measures Measures of changes in expected future profitability within a given time horizon resulting from interest rate movements, in case of IRRBB; or from credit spread changes, in case of CSRBB. It encompasses interest income and interest expenses. Net interest income measures plus market value changes Net interest income measures after the market value changes of instruments have been accounted for/taken into account depending on accounting treatment either through fair value measures or nGAAP. Economic value (EV) measures Measures of changes in the net present value of interest rate sensitive instruments over their remaining life resulting from interest rate movements, in case of IRRBB; or of changes in the net present value of instruments sensitive to credit spread changes over their remaining life resulting from credit spread movement, in case of CSRBB. EV measures reflect changes in value over the remaining life of the interest rate sensitive instruments, in case of IRRBB, or of the credit spread risk sensitive instruments, in case of CSRBB - i.e., until all positions have run off. Economic value of equity (EVE) measures A specific form of EV measure where equity is excluded from the cash flows. Conditional cash flow modelling Cash flow modelling under the assumption that the timing or amount of cash flows is dependent on the specific interest rate scenario. Unconditional cash flow modelling Cash flow modelling under the assumption that the timing and amount of cash flows is independent of the specific interest rate scenario. Run-off balance sheet A balance sheet including on- and off-balance- sheet items where existing non-trading book positions amortise and are not replaced by any new business. Dynamic balance sheet A balance sheet including on- and off-balance- sheet items incorporating future business expectations, adjusted for the relevant scenario in a consistent manner. 14 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF INTEREST RATE RISK AND CREDIT SPREAD RISK ARISING FROM NON-TRADING BOOK ACTIVITIES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Constant balance sheet A balance sheet including on- and off-balance- sheet items in which the total size and composition are maintained by replacing maturing or repricing cash flows with new cash flows that have comparable features with regard to the amount, repricing period and spread components. Retail A natural person or a SME, where the SME would qualify for the retail exposure class under the Standardised or IRB approaches for credit risk, or a company which is eligible for the treatment set out in Article 153(4) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and where the aggregate deposits by that SME or company on a group basis do not exceed EUR 1 million. Transactional deposit and accounts Transactional deposits and transactional accounts are those retail non-maturity deposits where regular transactions are carried out (e.g., where salaries are regularly credited) or those retail non-maturity deposits which are non-interest bearing even in a high interest rate environment. Other retail deposits shall be considered as held in a non-transactional account. IRRBB measures Economic Value (EV) measures and Net interest income measures plus market value changes, applied in the context of the sensitivity to changes in the interest rates. CSRBB measures Economic Value (EV) measures and Net interest income measures plus market value changes, applied in the context of the sensitivity to changes in market credit/liquidity spreads. 15 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF INTEREST RATE RISK AND CREDIT SPREAD RISK ARISING FROM NON-TRADING BOOK ACTIVITIES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY",

The management body should determine the institution's overall IRRBB strategy and approve the corresponding policies and processes. The management body may, however, delegate the monitoring and management of IRRBB to senior management, expert individuals or an asset and liability management committee under the conditions further specified in paragraph 42. (b) That they have in place an IRRBB management framework that establishes clear lines of responsibilities and that consists of a limit system, policies, processes and internal controls including regular independent reviews and evaluations of the effectiveness of the framework. (c) That the arrangements, processes and mechanisms referred for the assessment of IRRBB are comprehensive and proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of the risks inherent in the business model and the institution's activities. 22 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF INTEREST RATE RISK AND CREDIT SPREAD RISK ARISING FROM NON-TRADING BOOK ACTIVITIES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY",

The management body should ensure that there is clear guidance regarding the risk appetite for IRRBB in respect of the institution's business strategies. (b) Establishing that the appropriate actions are taken to identify, measure, monitor and control IRRBB, consistent with the approved strategies and policies. In this regard, the management body or its delegates are responsible for setting: i. appropriate limits on IRRBB, including the definition of specific procedures and approvals necessary for exceptions, and ensuring compliance with those limits; ii. systems and standards for measuring IRRBB, valuing positions and assessing performance, including procedures for updating interest rate shocks, parameters and stress scenarios and key underlying assumptions driving the institution's IRRBB analysis; iii. a comprehensive IRRBB reporting and review process; and iv. effective internal controls and management information systems (MISs). (c) Approving major hedging or risk-taking initiatives in advance of implementation. Positions related to internal risk transfers between the non-trading book and the trading book should be properly documented. (d) Carrying out the oversight of the approval, implementation and review of IRRBB management policies, procedures and limits. The level of and changes in the institution's IRRBB exposure should be provided regularly to the management body (at least quarterly). (e) Ensuring that the validation of IRRBB measurement methods and assessment of corresponding model risk are included in a formal policy process that should be reviewed and approved by the management body or its delegates. (f) Understanding and assessing the functioning of its delegates in monitoring and controlling IRRBB, consistent with policies approved by the management body, on the basis of regular reviews of timely and sufficiently detailed information. (g) Understanding the implications of the institution's IRRBB strategies and their potential linkages with market, liquidity, credit and operational risk but without requiring all the management body members to be experts in the area. Some of the members should have sufficient technical knowledge to question and challenge the reports made to the management body. The institution should establish that management body members are responsible for ensuring that senior management has the competence to understand IRRBB and that IRRBB management is provided with adequate resources. 23 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF INTEREST RATE RISK AND CREDIT SPREAD RISK ARISING FROM NON-TRADING BOOK ACTIVITIES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY",

(b) The management body should ensure that there is an adequate separation of responsibilities in the risk management process for IRRBB. The IRRBB identification, measurement, monitoring and control functions should have clearly defined responsibilities, should be independent from risk-taking functions on IRRBB and should report IRRBB exposures directly to the management body or its delegates. (c) The institution should ensure that the management body's delegates have clear lines of authority over the units responsible for risk taking on IRRBB. The communication channel to convey the delegates' directives to these line units should be clear. (d) The management body should establish that the institution's structure enables its delegates to carry out their responsibilities, and facilitates effective decision-making and governance. In this regard an ALCO, or its equivalent, should meet regularly and its composition should reflect each major department linked to IRRBB. The management body should foster discussion regarding the IRRBB management process, both between its members and its delegates and between its delegates and others in the institution. The management body should also ensure that regular communication between the risk management and strategic planning areas facilitate the monitoring of the risk arising from future business."

The risk may not be limited to interest income and expenses: the effects of changes in interest rates on the market value of instruments that, depending on accounting treatment, are reflected either through the profit and loss account or directly in equity (via other comprehensive income), should be taken into account separately. Institutions should particularly take into account the impact related to embedded optionalities in fair value instruments under ongoing interest rate shocks and stress scenarios. Institutions should also take into account the potential impact on the P&L accounts of hedging interest rate derivatives if their effectiveness was hampered by interest rate changes.",

(b) Limits may be associated with specific scenarios of changes in interest rates and term structures, such as their increase or decrease or a change in shape of the yield curve. The interest rate movements used in developing these limits should represent sufficiently adverse shock and stress situations, taking into account historical interest rate volatility and the time required by management to mitigate those risk exposures. (c) Policy limits should be appropriate to the nature, size, complexity and capital adequacy of the institution, as well as its ability to measure and manage its risks. (d) Depending on the nature of an institution's activities and business model, sub-limits may also be identified for individual business units, portfolios, instrument types, specific instruments or material sub-types of IRRBB risk such as gap risk, basis risk and option risk. (e) Systems should be in place to ensure that positions that exceed, or are likely to exceed, limits defined by the management body or its delegates receive prompt management attention and are escalated without delay. There should be a clear policy on who will be informed, how the communication will take place and the actions which will be taken in response.

Retail transactional deposits include non-interest-bearing and other retail accounts whose remuneration component is not relevant in the client's decision to hold money in the account. ii. Retail non-transactional deposits include retail accounts (including regulated ones) whose remuneration component is relevant in the client's decision to hold money in the account. ii. Wholesale deposits include accounts from corporate and other wholesale clients, excluding interbank accounts or other fully price-sensitive ones.

Duration analysis: Modified duration/PV01 of equity The modified duration approximates the relative change in the net present value of a financial instrument due to a marginal parallel shift of the yield curve by one percentage point. The modified duration of equity measures the exposure of an institution to gap risk in its non-trading book. PV01 of equity is derived from the modified duration of equity and measures the absolute change of the equity value resulting from a 1 basis point (0.01%) parallel shift of the yield curve. The starting point is the allocation of all cash flows of interest rate sensitive instruments into time buckets. For each instrument type, an appropriate yield curve is selected. The modified duration of each instrument is calculated from the change of its net present value due to a 1 percentage point parallel shift of the yield curve. The modified duration of equity is determined as the modified duration of assets times assets divided by Gap risk (only parallel risk) . The metric only applies to marginal shifts of the yield curve.

PV01 of equity is obtained by multiplying the modified duration of equity by the value of equity (i.e., assets minus liabilities) and dividing by 10 000 to arrive at the value change per basis point. · Partial modified duration/partial PV01 The partial modified duration of an instrument for a specific time bucket is calculated as the modified duration above, except that not the entire yield curve is shifted in parallel, but only the yield curve segment corresponding to the time bucket. These partial measures show the sensitivity of the market value of the banking book to a marginal shift of the yield curve in particular maturity segments. To each time bucket's partial measure a different magnitude of a shift can be applied, such that the effect of a change of the yield curve's shape can be computed for the entire portfolio.

Net interest income-based metrics can be differentiated according to the sophistication of projecting future cash flows: simple run-off models assume that existing assets and liabilities mature without replacement; constant balance sheet models assume that maturing assets and liabilities are replaced by comparable instruments; while the most complex dynamic cash flow models reflect business responses to differing interest rate environments in the size and composition of the banking book.

Where the complexity or scope of an institution's business model is significant, the institution should, notwithstanding its size, apply and implement risk measures that correspond to its specific business model and adequately capture all sensitivities. All material sensitivities to the interest rate changes should be adequately captured, including sensitivity to behavioural assumptions. Institutions that offer financial products containing embedded optionalities should use measurement systems that can adequately capture the dependence of options to interest rate changes. Institutions with products that provide behavioural optionalities to clients should use adequate conditional cash flow modelling approaches to quantify IRRBB with regard to the changes in client behaviour that could occur under different interest rate stress scenarios. The four categories referred to in the sophistication table below reflect the categorisation of institutions laid down in the EBA SREP Guidelines. The different categories reflect different size, structure and the nature, scope and complexity of activities of institutions; with Category 1 corresponding to the most sophisticated institutions. 54 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF INTEREST RATE RISK AND CREDIT SPREAD RISK ARISING FROM NON-TRADING BOOK ACTIVITIES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY IRRBB metric and modelling Indicative supervisory expectations regarding\non the institution's sophistication category IRRBB metric and modelling depending Cash flow modelling Metric Category 4 institution Category 3 institution Category 2 institution Category 1 institution Unconditional cash Net Interest Income- Time buckets advised in the Basel Committee on [Gap based on evolving size and composition of the flows (it is assumed based: Banking Supervision's\nManagement and Standards 'Principles for the Supervision of Interest Rate Risk banking book due to business responses to differing that the timing of cash Gap analysis: interest rate environments.

Indeed, and despite the perimeter in the current EBA GL, banks report other categories as exposed to CSRBB in practice and therefore banks should pay attention to all potential exposures to CSRBB irrespective of the asset or liability category they are. For these reasons the EBA opts for Policy option B for the definition of the perimeter.",
            "23.As regards the definition of CSRBB itself, the EBA considers that idiosyncratic elements should not be included since they are generally covered in other risk framework, mainly the credit risk. Considering these elements in the definition could trigger double counting issues. Also from a conceptual perspective, CSRBB is purely market related and therefore market and liquidity related elements should conform its definition. Nevertheless, after accounting for proportionality aspects and the qualitative QIS input mentioned in the previous item, the GL envisage some flexibility in the treatment of idiosyncratic elements, as long as the results would become more conservative. This is a good balance in the implementation between the pure definition of CSRBB and the operational difficulties that some banks might find in disentangling the idiosyncratic elements of credit spread risk. 62 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF INTEREST RATE RISK AND CREDIT SPREAD RISK ARISING FROM NON- TRADING BOOK ACTIVITIES"

Institutions' policies and procedures should specify which alternative, independent documentation it can rely upon to meet its CDD obliga- tions, where permitted by national law. These documents should be sufficiently reliable, i.e., up to date, issued by an official national or local authority and con- taining, as a minimum, the applicant's full name and date of birth. b. The steps to take where the customer is vulnerable and cannot provide traditional forms of identification or an address, for example because the customer is a refu- gee under the 1951 Geneva Convention or other relevant international treaties, or does not have a fixed address. Institutions' policies and procedures should specify which alternative, independent documentation it can rely upon. This documenta- tion may include, where permitted under national law, expired identity documents and documentation provided by an official authority, such as social services or a well-established not-for-profit organisation working on behalf of official authorities (Red Cross or similar), which also provides assistance to this customer. c. Similar steps may also be applied to individuals who are not granted a residence permit but whose expulsion is impossible for legal or factual reasons. In such situ- ations, credit and financial institutions' policies and procedures should have regard 12 FINAL REPORT ON EFFECTIVE ML/TF RISK MANAGEMENT AND ACCESS TO FINANCIAL SERVICES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY to certificates or documentation produced by an official authority or by an organi- sation providing support or legal assistance to those individuals on behalf of an official authority, where permitted by national law. Such authorities may include social work departments, home affairs ministries and migration services. These documents may be used as proof that the individual cannot be expulsed expelled in accordance with EU law. d. In cases where support for the persons referred to in points a., b. and c. is disbursed in the form of prepaid cards and where the conditions related to simplified due diligence are met as set out in guidelines 4.41, 9.15, 10.18 of the EBA's ML/TF Risk Factors Guidelines, policies and procedures should indicate that credit and financial institutions may postpone the application of initial customer due diligence measures to a later date. e. In cases where the persons referred to in points a., b. and c. apply for access to a payment account and are considered as presenting low ML/TF risks, policies and procedures should indicate which alternative forms of ID the institution may ac- cept and the options for postponing the application of full CDD until after the establishment of the business relationship.

            "2. Background and rationale Introduction The concept of the Internal Ratings Based (IRB) Approach for credit risk was first introduced by Directives 2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC of 14 June 2006 (known as the Capital Requirements Directive), later replaced by Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (Capital Requirements Regulation - CRR) and Directive 2013/36/EU of 26 June 2013 (Capital Requirements Directive - CRD). The CRR introduced a number of mandates for the European Banking Authority (EBA) to develop technical standards and guidelines to supplement the basic legislation in order to ensure more harmonised application of the IRB requirements. In this regard and in accordance with Article 502 of the CRR, the EBA published in December 2013 a set of five reports on the comparability and pro-cyclicality of capital requirements, presenting the results of a study conducted by the EBA on the comparability of risk estimates and capital requirements, including analysis of the factors that contribute to discrepancies among institutions. Based on the results, the EBA concluded that further guidance was needed, as current practices differed significantly across countries and institutions. Consequently, the EBA initiated work to provide further regulatory guidance, and these Guidelines on PD estimation, LGD estimation and the treatment of defaulted exposures (GL) are one of the resulting initiatives, specifically targeting the significant discrepancies identified in the methodologies underlying risk estimates. The sources of discrepancies identified in the area of modelling were related mostly to different definitions of the main concepts underlying the risk parameters, and different modelling choices made possible by the large degree of flexibility incorporated in the IRB framework. In addition, different understanding of regulatory requirements was also observed. These GL are therefore focused on aligning terminology and definitions, in particular in relation to metrics such as default rate or realised LGD, which are the basis for estimation of risk parameters. Furthermore, the GL provide clarification on the application of certain regulatory requirements which, until now, have been interpreted in various ways, and specify principles for the estimation of risk parameters, including those applicable to defaulted exposures. Although the GL may limit certain modelling choices, they are focused on the elements that lead to non-risk-based variability and intend to preserve sufficient flexibility to ensure risk sensitivity of the models. Therefore, the GL do not prescribe any specific estimation methodology, recognising that different approaches may be appropriate for different portfolios to reflect different risk profiles. The main objective of the GL is to provide the rules that will lead to increased comparability of the model outcomes. Differences in risk parameters between institutions should ideally reflect differences in the underlying risk rather than different modelling choices. In addition, clearer rules in that regard will limit the possibility for regulatory arbitrage. Other aspects of the models that are not explicitly prescribed in the GL, such as the choice of risk drivers and estimation methodology, will 5 GUIDELINES ON PD ESTIMATION, LGD ESTIMATION AND TREATMENT DEFAULTED EXPOSURES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY have to be justified on the basis of the risk profile of the portfolio covered by the model as well as the credit and recovery policies and efficiency of these processes. As the GL are part of a broader review of the IRB Approach carried out by the EBA they do not address all identified sources of risk-weighted asset (RWA) variability. The GL focus on aspects related to modelling of parameters such as PD, LGD, best estimate of expected loss (ELBE) and LGD in- default, whereas other elements, including the definition of default on which these parameters should be based, rating processes, data quality processes and other aspects of the application of the IRB Approach, are addressed in other regulatory products. The regulatory products, developed as part of the regulatory review of the IRB Approach as outlined in the Report published in February 20164, will affect nearly all aspects of the IRB Approach and, as a consequence, it is expected that they will be able to significantly reduce unjustified RWA variability, which is deemed to stem from the lack of sufficiently specified requirements with regard to certain aspects of the IRB Approach. These GL provide such specifications, where necessary, to achieve the objective of a Single Rulebook, as well as to regain public trust in the use of internal models. It has to be stressed that these GL include numerous references to the EBA draft Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) on IRB assessment methodology5, which set conditions for competent authorities to assess the rating systems of institutions. As the RTS contain rules for competent authorities on their assessment of the IRB methodologies, they also provides details to institutions about how competent authorities are expected to understand and apply aspects of the CRR in the course of their assessment. Therefore, these GL and the RTS mentioned above should be read together, as many aspects related to modelling have already been clarified in the RTS, and in these cases the provisions are not repeated in the GL. When implementing any changes in the rating systems stemming from the regulatory review of the IRB Approach, and also subsequently on a continuous basis, institutions should take into account not only these GL but also provisions included in other related regulatory products, in particular in the RTS on IRB assessment methodology, the RTS on materiality threshold for past due credit obligations, the GL on the application of the definition of default, and the RTS on the nature, severity and duration of economic downturn. As the RTS on the nature, severity and duration of economic downturn are still under development the requirements regarding the estimation of downturn LGD have not been included in the GL at this stage. Once the RTS have specified the identification of the downturn period the GL will be updated by adding a section clarifying how the impact of economic downturn should be reflected in the LGD estimates. In order not to pre-empt any decisions that will be taken when specifying the final RTS, it is considered appropriate that the RTS on the nature, severity and duration of economic downturn and the relevant section of the GL should be published together. Neither these GL nor any of the EBA's other regulatory products address the issue of the scope of application of the IRB Approach and modellability of low-default portfolios. These aspects are 4https://www.eba.europa.eu/documents/10180/1360107/EBA+Report+on+the+regulatory+review+of+the+IRB+Approach. pdf"

Supervisory approval (if necessary) 7 GUIDELINES ON PD ESTIMATION, LGD ESTIMATION AND TREATMENT DEFAULTED EXPOSURES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Figure 1 presents the scope of the GL in graphical format. The first two steps, i.e. model development and calibration, including preparation of data for each of these steps, form the full process of the estimation of a risk parameter. To capture specific aspects of the estimation of various risk parameters, the requirements in this regard have been specified in the GL separately for PD, LGD and parameters for defaulted exposures, i.e. ELBE and LGD in-default. Model development is understood in the GL as the part of the process of estimation of risk parameters that leads to appropriate risk differentiation, whereas calibration is the part of the estimation process that leads to appropriate risk quantification. These steps include preparation of various datasets for the purpose of model development and calibration. These datasets may be at least partly overlapping; however, it is not only the samples of data that may be different in each phase. The scope of necessary information, as well as requirements regarding data representativeness, are also different and hence will have to be assessed separately. Of those two phases, the GL put more focus on calibration, leaving significantly greater flexibility for institutions in model development. This approach is related to the objective of the GL to contribute to increased comparability of the risk estimates and the resulting own funds requirements. For this purpose, the GL provide detailed definitions of the main concepts underlying risk quantification, such as default rate and long-run average default rate for PD and realised LGD and long-run average LGD for LGD quantification. At the same time, the GL intend to preserve the risk sensitivity of the IRB Approach, and hence more flexibility is given in the model development, with the intention that risk differentiation should be reflective of the institution's specific risk profile. The three subsequent steps presented in the chart in grey, comprising internal independent validation, supervisory approval for the rating systems and their material changes, and implementation of the models in the IT systems and internal processes of the institution, are not within the scope of these GL. It is considered that sufficient clarifications in that regard have been provided in the RTS on IRB assessment methodology, and in Regulation (EU) No 529/2014 on the materiality of extensions and changes of the IRB Approach and the Advanced Measurement Approach. Under step 6, the estimated risk parameter are applied by the institutions in the calculation of own funds requirements, as well as in internal risk management and decision making processes. The GL clarify only selected aspects of the application of the risk parameters, including additional conservatism in the application of risk parameters, the use of human judgement and overrides, and certain clarifications regarding the use of risk parameters. As the required areas of the use test have already been specified in the RTS on IRB assessment methodology, these GL only complement these requirements with the clarification on the possible deviations between the parameters used for the purpose of own funds requirements and those used in internal processes. While the calculation of risk weights and risk-weighted exposure amounts based on risk parameters is not in the scope of the GL, additional clarification is provided on a specific regulatory area of use of the risk parameters, namely the calculation of IRB shortfall or excess based on the amount of expected loss, in accordance with Article 159 of the CRR. This section of the GL is also complementary to the requirements provided in the RTS on IRB assessment methodology. 8 GUIDELINES ON PD ESTIMATION, LGD ESTIMATION AND TREATMENT DEFAULTED EXPOSURES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Finally, the GL provide clarifications on the regular reviews of risk parameters, which is presented as step 7 on the chart, including the required scope of annual reviews. The additional arrows within the circle present actions that may be taken as a result of a review. The GL leave flexibility in that regard, and specify that the actions should be appropriate to the character and severity of the identified deficiencies. The appropriate actions could therefore entail redevelopment of the model, recalibration of risk parameters or additional analysis to be performed, for instance as an ad hoc validation. Structure of the rating systems Rating systems should be developed for specific types of exposures, i.e. groups of exposures that are homogeneously managed in accordance with the definition included in Article 142(1) of the CRR. The type of exposures for which the rating system is developed form the range of application of a rating system. A rating system encompasses a PD model and an LGD model (or regulatory LGDs in case an institution does not use own estimates of LGD), and any other credit risk assessment methods, including in particular conversion factors. The scope of application of a PD or LGD model may be different from the range of application of a rating system, as long as exposures covered by the rating system are assigned to a common obligor and facility rating scales. A PD model may entail various ranking methods. A common example of such a combination may be an application or customer scorecard and a behavioural scorecard for retail exposures, where the use of a given scorecard may depend on, among others, the availability of the necessary input data. Furthermore, the calibration of either PD or LGD may be performed separately for different calibration segments. This may be necessary where the scope of application of a PD or LGD model includes portfolios of exposures which carry significantly different level of risk, for instance because of different geographical locations. The scope of application of a given ranking method may not be aligned with the scope of application of a calibration segment. Where a calibration segment includes obligors or exposures that are subject to different ranking methods, the scores resulting from these methods should be normalised to perform a meaningful calibration. The relations between these different notions are presented in a schematic manner in Figure 2. Figure 2: Possible structure of the rating system Range of application of a rating system Rating system Scope of application of a PD or LGD model PD model LGD model Other risk assessment methods Model development for each ranking method Ranking method 1 Ranking method 2 Calibration at the level of calibration segment Calibration segment 1 Calibration segment 2 Calibration segment 1 Calibration segment 2 9 GUIDELINES ON PD ESTIMATION, LGD ESTIMATION AND TREATMENT DEFAULTED EXPOSURES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Structure of the guidelines Figure 3 presents the structure of the GL, in which the requirements related to the estimation of risk parameters are split into two highly interlinked main phases, as introduced above: \" model development - for the purpose of risk differentiation; \" calibration - for the purpose of risk quantification. Both phases start with the preparation of an appropriate set of data and the verification of the quality of data. However, the scope of data and the assessment of representativeness are different in each phase. In principle, data used for model development is a selection of an appropriate sample which is highly representative of the application portfolio, and hence provides the best basis for effective risk differentiation. This sample should contain information on all relevant risk drivers. On the other hand, the data used for calculating long-run average default rate or LGD for the purpose of calibration has to contain all observations from the relevant historical observation period. In this case, the lack of sufficient representativeness cannot provide the basis for excluding the data from the calculation. Instead, any identified issues are assessed from the perspective of their influence on risk quantification and, if a bias in risk quantification is identified, it has to be addressed through an appropriate adjustment and margin of conservatism (MoC). Once the appropriate data sample has been prepared the phase of model development consists of finding the relevant risk drivers and using them, on the basis of a chosen methodology, to rank or differentiate the obligors or exposures to grades or pools, according to the level of risk. In the case of LGD, this includes in particular analysis of the available collaterals. Institutions may use various methodologies, and they may in particular combine different ranking methods under one PD model. Depending on the model design, the phase of model development may also entail estimation of intermediate risk parameters. This is a common approach in particular in the case of LGD models, where the design of the model may include components such as cure rate, work-out recovery rate, etc. These components would in this case be referred to as intermediate parameters subject to separate estimation in the phase of model development. The phase of calibration has an objective of assigning adequate levels of risk parameters to grades or pools, or, in the case of direct estimates on a continuous rating scale, to individual obligors or exposures. The adequate levels of PD should be reflective of the long-run average default rate, whereas adequate levels of LGD should be the higher of the LGD based on the long-run average LGD and the LGD reflective of the downturn conditions. In practice, this is often achieved by applying a downturn adjustment to the estimate based on the long-run average LGD. In some cases, the calibration phase may include the design of grades or pools; this may be the case in particular where a master scale with fixed parameters is used. Under this methodology, the phase of model development is focused only on the ranking of obligors or exposures, and the boundaries of the grades are defined only in the phase of calibration based on the predefined levels of the risk parameters. 10 GUIDELINES ON PD ESTIMATION, LGD ESTIMATION AND TREATMENT DEFAULTED EXPOSURES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Figure 3: Structure of the guidelines Non- defaulted Model development Calibration parameters PD"

For the purpose of point (b) of paragraph 115 institutions should determine the value of repossession as the value by which the credit obligation of the obligor has been diminished as a result of the repossession of the collateral, and with which the repossessed collateral was recorded as an asset on the balance sheet of the institution. Where these values are different institutions should consider the lower of the two the value of repossession. The value of repossession should be considered a value of recovery at the date of repossession and should be included in the calculation of the economic loss and realised LGD in accordance with section 6.3.1.",

Institutions should consider whether the value of repossession adequately reflects the value of the repossessed collateral, consistently with any established internal requirements for collateral management, legal certainty and risk management. Where the collateral repossessed meets the criteria for high quality liquid assets at Level 1, as defined in Article 10 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61, institutions may take into account directly as a realised recovery the market value of the collateral at the time of the repossession. In all other cases institutions should apply an appropriate haircut to the value of repossession and include in the calculation of economic loss a recovery in the amount of the value of repossession after applying the appropriate haircut. Institutions should estimate this haircut taking into account all of the following conditions: (a) the haircut should reflect possible errors in the valuation of the collateral at the moment of repossession taking into account the type of the valuation available at the moment of repossession, the date it was performed and the liquidity of the market for this type of asset; (b) the haircut should be estimated with the assumption that the institution intends to sell the repossessed collateral to an independent third party and should reflect the potential price that could be achieved from such sale, the costs of the sale and the discounting effect for the period from the sale to the moment of repossession taking into account the liquidity of the market for this type of assets; (c) where there are observations available regarding the repossessions and subsequent sales of similar types of collaterals the estimation of the haircut should be based on these observations and should be regularly backtested; for this purpose institutions should take into account all of the following: 77 GUIDELINES ON PD ESTIMATION, LGD ESTIMATION AND TREATMENT DEFAULTED EXPOSURES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY (i) the difference between the value of repossession and the sale price, especially where there were no significant changes in market and economic conditions between the moment of the repossession and the moment of the sale; (ii) any income and costs related to this asset that were observed between the date of repossession and the moment of the sale; (iii) discounting effects; (iv) whether the institution repossessed the collateral with the intention of immediate sale or whether another strategy was adopted. (d) where historical observations regarding the repossessions and subsequent sales of similar types of collaterals are not available the estimation of the haircut should be based on a case-by-case assessment, including the analysis of the current market and economic conditions; (e) the fewer data an institution has on previous repossessions and the less liquid the market for the given type of assets is, the more uncertainty is attached to the resulting estimates, which should be adequately reflected in the MoC in accordance with section 4.4.3.",

Any sale of credit obligations in accordance with point (d) of paragraph 115 should be included in the LGD estimation in a manner appropriate to the LGD estimation methodology taking into account all of the following conditions: (a) where institutions regularly sell credit obligations as part of their recovery processes, they should appropriately reflect the observations related to credit obligations subject to the sale in the model development process; (b) where institutions do not regularly sell credit obligations as part of their recovery processes and the allocation of the part of the price related to collaterals is too burdensome to make or too unreliable, they may decide not to take these observations into account in the process of model development; (c) institutions should not treat recoveries from the sales of the secured credit obligations as recoveries realised without the use of collaterals unless they can demonstrate that the recoveries related to these collaterals are immaterial; (d) in any case institutions should include all observations, including the sales of credit obligations, in the calculation of long-run average LGD. 78 GUIDELINES ON PD ESTIMATION, LGD ESTIMATION AND TREATMENT DEFAULTED EXPOSURES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY",

In accordance with point (f) of paragraph 115 institutions may specify and recognise any other forms of realising collaterals adequate to the types of collaterals used by the institution that are eligible under the applicable legal framework. When recognising such other forms of realising collateral, institutions should take into account the fact that the collateral may take various forms and that various forms of collaterals may be related to the same asset. Where different forms of collateral refer to the same asset but the realisation of one of the collaterals does not decrease the value of the other, institutions should consider them separate collaterals in the process of LGD estimation. In particular, institutions should recognise separately the form of collateral which gives a right to repossess or sell the asset (such as a mortgage) and the form of collateral which gives a right to collect cash flows generated by the asset (such as a cession of rent or fees)."

Where institutions have experienced decreases in values of collaterals and these are already reflected in observed recoveries, no further adjustments to the LGD estimates based on these observations should be made. Where potential decreases in values of collaterals are not reflected in historical observations or where institutions predict further, potentially more severe decreases in the future, they should be included in the quantification of LGD estimates by means of an appropriate adjustment based on forward-looking expectations. However, the LGD estimates should not be adjusted to take into account any potential increases in collateral value; (h) the estimates should take into account in a conservative manner the degree of dependence between the risk of the obligor and the risk of the diminishing value of the collateral as well as the cost of liquidating the collateral."

This analysis provides the reader with an overview of the findings as regards problem identification, options identified to remove problems and their potential impacts. The following analysis consists basically of three parts, where the baseline scenario in terms of current practices and supervisory expectations starts from the analysis performed for the purpose of the reports on comparability and pro-cyclicality of capital requirements published by the EBA in December 2013. In terms of the regulatory environment, the baseline scenario is set out by the GL specified by the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) in 2006 (GL 10), under the assumption that this guidance has been followed by institutions when developing their risk parameter estimation methodologies. The second part contains the options considered with respect to the major policy decisions that have been analysed and discussed in the finalisation of these GL. Finally, the draft cost-benefit analysis is based on the main policy changes in comparison with the currently applicable GL 10. For the second part of this analysis, i.e. the options considered, a reference is included to the Report on the IRB modelling practices, which contains the impact assessment for the GLs on PD, LGD and the treatment of defaulted exposures based on the IRB survey results. Shortly after the publication of the Consultation Paper (CP) of these GLs, the EBA conducted a qualitative survey on institution's current modelling practices (i.e. the IRB survey) on several of the policy choices addressed in these GL. A summary of the responses to this IRB survey will be published together with these GL. Given that the distribution of current modelling practices stemming from the IRB survey has been taken into account in several of the policy choices in these GL, the impact assessment, i.e. the analysis of the pros and cons of the policy options considered, is also presented in that report. Accordingly, the report is a joint report on the impact assessment for the GL and the results of the IRB survey. In order not to duplicate these analyses, in section D below (Options considered), the reader is referred to the relevant sections in the Report on the IRB modelling practices. A. Problem identification The EBA reports on comparability and pro-cyclicality of RWAs have identified significant non- risk-based variability of capital requirements calculated in accordance with the IRB Approach, and have provided recommendations on regulatory measures that should be taken to achieve greater comparability of risk parameters. All issues that have been considered while developing these GL refer to the identification and/or limitation of drivers of unjustified RWA variability in 103 GUIDELINES ON PD ESTIMATION, LGD ESTIMATION AND TREATMENT DEFAULTED EXPOSURES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY the context of PD and LGD estimation, and the treatment of defaulted assets for IRB institutions. B. Policy objectives The objective of the GL is to establish convergence of institutions' and supervisory definitions related to PD and LGD estimation and the treatment of defaulted assets, as well as the convergence of institutions' methodological choices in developing PD and LGD models where these choices are considered to be drivers of unjustified RWA variability. The GL are complementary to the RTS on IRB assessment methodology (EBA/RTS/2016/03) where some technical choices related to PD and LGD estimation, as well as to the treatment of defaulted assets, are already regulated. In particular, provisions related to data requirements, the estimation of the long-run average PD and the calculation of the long-run average LGD as a simple average with respect to the number of defaults refer to the RTS on IRB assessment methodology as a starting point. The GL aim to define common notions and criteria in the major policy fields including: a) a framework for the MoC; b) PD: one-year default rates (frequency of motoring); c) PD: long-run average default rates; d) LGD: additional drawings after default, and interest and fees capitalised after the moment of default; e) LGD: measurement of economic loss for a cured cases; f) LGD: discount rate; g) LGD: incomplete recovery processes; h) LGD: treatment of cases with no loss or positive outcome; i) LGD: recognition of recovery values in the calculation of the realised LGD. C. Baseline scenario The baseline scenario is specified on the basis of data collected from competent authorities in 2013 for the purpose of the Report on comparability of supervisory practices. The findings are summarised in the Table 3. 104 GUIDELINES ON PD ESTIMATION, LGD ESTIMATION AND TREATMENT DEFAULTED EXPOSURES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Table 3: Baseline scenario for supervisory practices Paragraphs\nin the CP Subject Findings from Report on the comparability of supervisory rules and practices PD estimation 23-35 MoC (i.e. rules concerning the conservatism in the PD parameter and rating systems for data or model weaknesses) In general, most competent authorities (CAs) confirm the requirement that conservatism should be applied for data and model issues, and none of the CAs provides guidance on the level of conservatism that is expected. Given this, the adequacy of the level of conservatism is mainly assessed on a case-by-case basis, and fewer than 30% of CAs have rules on this topic, most being non-public. These rules concern the following aspects: (i) one CA requires that a MoC be applied for low default portfolio models and for models primarily based on human judgement; (ii) one CA requires an explicit statistical approach to assess the MoC, combined with a qualitative adjustment when the defaults are fewer than 20; (iii) one CA requires that conservatism be applied to address the 'seasonal peak' for mortgages; (iv) another mentions that a non- compliant definition of default should be addressed by a MoC; (v) another mentions that institutions should have a methodology to assess the MoC, taking into account the results of the validation and the results of self- assessment; and finally (vi) one CA mentions that a supervisory add-on will compensate for institutions' lack of conservatism. 21, 45 and 48-63 Data requirements (i.e. rules regarding the use of internal default rates, mapping with external ratings or use of statistical PD model) and calculation of observed default rates One third of the CAs specify rules concerning the PD estimation approach, almost all non-public. In general, the use of internal default rates or statistical approaches is promoted or requested as long as the data are relevant and representative. For low default portfolios, the mapping with external rating or expert models is usually tolerated, but (i) with the use of an additional level of conservatism, or (ii) where benchmarking should be performed with other approaches, and where the institutions are encouraged to collect data to develop statistical models in due time. Some CAs, however, allow all approaches without restriction. 59-63 Historical observation period (i.e. rules on the business cycle/'downturn period') Whereas the majority of CAs reported rules on the topic, these rules were public and binding in only two cases. However these rules are usually not specific, but rather general and 'principle based'. A wide variety in requirements has been observed; examples are that institutions should generally include (i) good and bad 105 GUIDELINES ON PD ESTIMATION, LGD ESTIMATION AND TREATMENT DEFAULTED EXPOSURES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY 64-67 Risk drivers and rating criteria (i.e. rules concerning the assessment of the choice of variables that influence the PD estimation) economic periods, (ii) periods when higher credit losses are experienced, (iii) at least one recession period, (iv) a complete economic cycle (good and bad years), or (v) specific periods in the datasets (e.g. 1991-2008). Only few CAs specify the years of reference for a recession period or a complete cycle. Some CAs mention that different weights can be applied to data (higher weights to more recent data) if adequately motivated. Approximately one third of CAs have rules on this topic, most being non-public and general, in the sense that the most relevant variables should be included in the model and missing variables are challenged. In two Member States, there is a requirement that there should be risk drivers or rating criteria on some key groups of variables (such as characteristics of the borrower, terms of the transaction, collateral, unpaid amounts, etc). When it comes to assessing the information value of the risk drivers, some Member States specify a threshold for the p-value of the regression, whereas others specify more general rules regarding the adequacy of the discriminatory power. 75-79 Design of grades or pools More than 40% of CAs have rules concerning the number of grades, which are usually public and binding. The majority stick to the minimum number of grades fixed by the CRD (seven plus default); one CA increases the number to 10 for wholesale portfolios. Related rules in some Member States require that the number of pools and grades should be high enough to allow adequate quantification and validation. In one Member State, the concentration across the rating scale should be assessed by the Hirschman-Herfindahl index. In another Member State, the concentration in one grade should not be greater than 30% unless the grade covers a reasonably narrow PD band. Another CA applies a 25% limit for the wholesale portfolios. These rules, however, do not apply to low default portfolios, where a case-by- case approach is typically allowed. 75-79 Rating philosophy (i.e. rules specifying how stable rating assignments should be during the economic cycle, or how much they should change with the economic context Very few CAs appeared to have rules on this topic, mostly non-public, and only one CA publicly requires ratings to be TTC. One CA explicitly assesses the stability of the ratings, and another specifically allows hybrid systems. Some of the other CAs note that they implicitly allow for all rating philosophies, leaving the choice to institutions. The CAs seem to focus on the inclusion of all relevant and recent information regarding the credit quality of obligors. 106 GUIDELINES ON PD ESTIMATION, LGD ESTIMATION AND TREATMENT DEFAULTED EXPOSURES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY (Point-In-Time (PIT), Through-The-Cycle (TTC) or hybrid philosophies) The CAs have also been asked whether or not they have rules concerning the dynamics of the transitions of exposures or clients among rating classes. However, only three CAs reported rules on the topic, all non-public. This means in particular that they monitor/challenge the migration matrices to assess their stability, at various stages of the economic cycle. For two CAS, analysis regarding the stability of migration matrices is conducted only during the approval process of the IRB Approach."

            "4.1: Do you agree with the proposed requirements with regard to the application of appropriate adjustments and margin of conservatism? Do you have any operational concerns with respect to the proposed categorisation? MoC general framework One respondent wondered whether the categories and examples included in the background and rationale section of the CP should be seen as a checklist of potential triggers of MoC, in the sense that the potential outcome for an institution may be a zero MoC for certain triggers. One respondent agreed that this should be the case, but another respondent argued that such a checklist would be strictly interpreted by supervisors as requiring an MoC for each individual category. This respondent disagreed with this annex. Due to the confusion about the nature of the list of triggers of MoC in the background and rationale section of the CP, the list has been removed from the final GL. Due to the specificities of triggers of MoC, it is deemed more appropriate to allow institutions to specify a list of all identified deficiencies along with the categories in which they are classified, without including in the GL an example of what such list of triggers might look like. Nevertheless, the GL do contain a non-exhaustive list of triggers of MoC, which institutions should analyse under the relevant categories. Institutions should also create for each rating system a complete list of Changes to the background and rationale section 123 GUIDELINES ON PD ESTIMATION, LGD ESTIMATION AND TREATMENT DEFAULTED EXPOSURES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received EBA analysis Amendments to the proposals references to final GL all identified deficiencies, including the categories in which these deficiencies are classified. Whereas several respondents welcomed the clarification of the MoC and adjustment framework set out in the GL, many raised concerns with respect to the practical feasibility of quantifying all MoCs for the individual categories. Some also mentioned that institutions currently already include adjustments and MoC in their estimations. Some respondents wondered whether the benefits of the proposed framework outweighed the costs. One bank argued that it would be operationally difficult to implement this framework by end-2020. One respondent argued that an MoC should only be applied as a last-resort measure, and that other ways to address a deficiency should be explored first. One respondent argued that the MoC framework introduced judgement and subjectivity, which comes at the expense of risk sensitivity. Based on this feedback, it has been decided to construct a different list of categories, which should facilitate the quantification of MoC by category, so that overlaps between triggers of MoC in different categories can be avoided. The new categories to be identified are the following: category A - MOC related to data and methodological deficiencies; category B - MoC related to relevant changes to underwriting standards, risk appetite, collection and recovery policies, and any other source of additional uncertainty; category C - general estimation error. The GL contain a non-exhaustive list of deficiencies that would fall into categories A and B. Changes to section 4.4 Some respondents opined that the scope of MoCs should be clarified, as should the methodologies that should be used (i.e. using confidence intervals or otherwise). Others mentioned that the GL should specify how the quantification should be performed. Although the EBA considered specifying how MoC should be quantified, it has been taken into account that a wide variety of practices exists, which corresponds to the different possible natures of the potential deficiencies and uncertainties. Therefore, the preferred approach, taken in the GL, is to specify a list of minimum conditions for the quantification of MoCs in each category, without prescribing a detailed methodology. As regards the clarification of the scope of MoC, it should be mentioned that an MoC should cover at least the expected range of Changes to section 4.4.3 124 GUIDELINES ON PD ESTIMATION, LGD ESTIMATION AND TREATMENT DEFAULTED EXPOSURES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received EBA analysis Amendments to the proposals references to final GL estimation errors, as required by Article 179(1)(f) and Article 180(1)(e) of the CRR. Since it would be impossible to anticipate all possible triggers of MoC, the GL contain a non-exhaustive list of potential deficiencies. Several respondents requested that the GL clarify that an MoC may be zero. It is specified in the GL that an MoC stemming from category C (general estimation error) should be greater than zero, whereas an MoC corresponding to category A or B should be greater than or equal to zero. Changes to paragraph 47 One respondent mentioned that the GL should clarify whether an adjustment may be negative, that an MoC may also be positive, and whether adjustments and MoC may or should be used together. Paragraph 26 of the CP on the GL already makes clear that the appropriate adjustment may be either positive or negative. This clarification has been retained in the final GL in paragraph 39. No change Some respondents requested clarification of the interaction between the use test and the MoC. Two respondents wonder whether it would still be possible to pass the use test after the implementation of the MoC framework under the GL. It was argued that institutions might typically want to use the model with the economic adjustment, and without the MoC, or with a lower MoC than the regulatory requirement, for their internal purposes. A new section 8.3. has been inserted in the final GL in order to clarify aspects related to the use test. The GL provide an exhaustive list of possible deviations from the parameters used for own funds requirements calculation that can be applied for internal purposes. However, the use of parameters in both obligatory and optional areas of the use test does not preclude taking into account information from other sources as well. The combination of the information on internal ratings or risk parameters and any other relevant information should lead to an appropriate management decision in accordance with the institution's policy. The requirements for the use test specified in these GL should be read New section 8.3 125 GUIDELINES ON PD ESTIMATION, LGD ESTIMATION AND TREATMENT DEFAULTED EXPOSURES EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY Comments Summary of responses received EBA analysis Amendments to the proposals references to final GL together with the RTS on IRB assessment methodology, which in Articles 18 to 21 specify obligatory and optional areas of the use test. One respondent argued that the MoC framework proposed in the GL should be applied only to new model approvals and material model changes, and that it would be inappropriate to require retrospective application of the framework to existing models. Another respondent flagged this aspect as well, pointing out that the treatment of existing models is not clear from the GL. The EBA issued its Opinion on the implementation of the revision of the IRB Approach 14 in February 2016; the expected implementation timeline is specified in it based on previous consultations. In this opinion, it is established that the full review of internal models should be implemented by end-2020. The MoC framework is an integral part of PD and LGD estimation, and hence all internal models will have to comply with the final GL as well as the other aspects of the new regulatory framework by end- 2020. No change Identification of deficiencies Several respondents argued that the EBA should provide definitions for the categories and methodological aspects of MoC estimation. It was mentioned that the differences between categories A, B, C and D were not clear. It was also suggested that further standardisation of the criteria for the adjustments and MoC identification and quantification should be provided. For some respondents, it was mainly category C that was unclear. Some mentioned that, without this clarification, the MoC framework would lead to even less comparable estimates among banks. The EBA has further discussed the scope and definitions of the various categories. Based on the comments and difficulties associated with certain overlaps, it has been decided to redesign the categories and provide greater clarity where necessary. Note that paragraph 38 of the final GL contains a non-exhaustive list of potential deficiencies that should be analysed. Given the divergent nature of deficiencies and the multitude of possible methodologies that can be used to assess the appropriate adjustments and the MoC, it would not be beneficial to specify or limit methodologies for either the appropriate adjustments or the Changes to section 4.4"

            "(1) Solvency stress test means the assessment of the impact of certain developments, including macro- or microeconomic scenarios, on the overall capital position of an institution, including on its minimum or additional own funds requirements, by means of projecting the institution's capital resources and requirements, highlighting the institution's vulnerabilities and assessing its 11 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INSTITUTIONS' STRESS TESTING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY capacity to absorb losses and the impact on its solvency position.",
            "(2) Liquidity stress test means the assessment of the impact of certain developments, including macro- or microeconomic scenarios, from a funding and liquidity perspective and shocks on the overall liquidity position of an institution, including on its minimum or additional requirements.",
            "(3) Bottom-up stress test means a (solvency or liquidity) stress test with all of the following characteristics: i. it is carried out by institutions using their own internally developed models; ii. it is based on the institution's own assumptions or scenarios, with possible conservative constrains by authorities; iii. it is based on the institution's own data and potentially high level of data granularity, with possible use of external data for some additional information; and iv. it concerns particular portfolios or the institution as a whole, producing detailed results on the potential impact of exposure concentrations, institution linkages and contagion probabilities to the institution's loss rates.",
            "(4) Top-down stress test means a (solvency or liquidity) stress test with all of the following characteristics: i. it is carried out by competent authorities or macroprudential authorities; ii. it is based on general or systemic (macroprudential) assumptions or scenarios designed by competent or macroprudential authorities and applicable to all relevant institutions; iii. competent authorities or macroprudential authorities manage the process and calculate the results with less 12 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INSTITUTIONS' STRESS TESTING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY involvement of the institutions than in the case of the bottom-up stress test; iv. it is based mostly on aggregate institution data and less detailed information, depending on the assumptions of the stress test, or sometimes based on more detailed institution data if deemed necessary by authorities; and V. it enables a uniform and a common framework and comparative assessment of the impact of a given stress testing exercise across institutions.",
            "(5) Static balance sheet assumption means a methodological assumption according to which the impact of the stress test scenarios is to be measured on the assumption of a 'constant balance sheet' and of an 'unchanged or stable business model' throughout the projection period, enhancing the comparability of the results across institutions, thereby: i. prohibiting from taking into account, for the calculation of the impact of the scenarios, changes in the assets and liabilities of the institution that derive, indicatively, from management actions, increases or work-outs of existing lending or differences in maturities or other characteristics of these assets or liabilities (despite the application of the stress test methodology, which might lead to changes in the size and the composition of the balance sheet, and particularly the capital base, over the projection period, due to, for example, new defaults, impairments, increases of stock or value adjustments of financial assets); and ii. permitting the inclusion of new assets and liabilities as far as these new items bear the same main characteristics (maturities, risk profiles, etc.) with the excluded ones.",
            "(6) Dynamic balance sheet\nassumption means a methodological assumption according to which the impact of the stress test scenario is to be measured on the possibility of a non-constant balance sheet and of an evolving business model throughout the projection period. Under the 13 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INSTITUTIONS' STRESS TESTING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY dynamic balance sheet assumption, the outcome of the stress test reflects a combination of the scenario imposed and the responsive actions taken by the management reducing the comparability of the results across institutions. The extent of responsive actions taken by the management may be constrained or unconstrained (e.g. interventions planned from the start and independent from the scenario and/or conditional on the stress test scenario).",

            "(10) Reverse stress test means an institution stress test that starts from the identification of the pre-defined outcome (e.g. points at which an institution business model becomes unviable, or at which the institution can be considered as failing or likely to fail in the meaning of Article 32 of Directive 2014/59/EU) and then explores scenarios and circumstances that might cause this to occur. Reverse stress testing should have one or more of the following characteristics: 14 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INSTITUTIONS' STRESS TESTING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY i. it is used as a risk management tool aimed at increasing the institution's awareness of its vulnerabilities by means of the institution explicitly identifying and assessing the scenarios (or a combination of scenarios) that result in a pre-defined outcome; ii. the institution decides on the kind and timing (triggering events) of management or other actions necessary for both (a) rectifying business failures or other problems; and (b) aligning its risk appetite with the actual risks revealed by the reverse stress testing; iii. specific reverse stress testing can be also applied in the context of recovery planning (e.g. reverse stress tests applied in a wider context can be used to inform a recovery plan stress test by identifying the conditions under which the recovery might need to be planned).",
            "(11) Second-round or feedback effects means the spillover effects (the nature of feedback effects is not limited to macroeconomic effects) caused by the responses of individual institutions to an external original shock, which - in aggregate - generally amplify (it may also mitigate) such an original shock, thereby causing an additional negative feedback loop.",
            "(12) Severity of scenario means the degree of severity of the assumptions or the deterioration of the scenario (from baseline to an adverse scenario) expressed in terms of the underlying macroeconomic and financial variables (or any other assumptions). The greater the severity of the scenario, in general, the larger the impact of the stress test on the institution, thereby determining the actual severity of the stress test.",
            "(13) Plausibility of scenario means the degree to which a scenario can be regarded as likely to materialise in respect of the consistency of the relationship of that scenario with the current macroeconomic and financial variables, the support of the scenario by a coherent narrative and the backing of the scenario by probability distribution and historical experiences. Plausibility is not restricted to historical 15 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INSTITUTIONS' STRESS TESTING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY experiences, and hence expert judgements that take into account changing risk environments (e.g. observed structural breaks) and stress events that were observed in similar risk environments outside the institution's own direct historical experience should play a key role. It is also possible to use simulative methods (e.g. Monte Carlo simulations).",
            "(14) Anchor scenario means a type of scenario usually designed by a competent authority to set the severity standard for a particular stress test, which is imposed on institutions, either as the scenario that should be applied in the stress test or as a severity benchmark for the development of the institution's own scenarios.",
            "(15) Risk data aggregation means defining, gathering and processing risk data according to the institution's risk reporting requirements to enable the institution to measure its performance against its risk tolerance/appetite. This includes sorting, merging or breaking down sets of data.",
            "(16) Data infrastructure means physical and organisational structures and facilities to build and maintain data and information technology (IT) architecture to support the institution's risk data aggregation and internal policy on risk reporting. 16 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INSTITUTIONS' STRESS TESTING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY",

Institutions should work backwards in a quantitative manner to identify the risk factors, and the required amplitude of changes, that could cause such a loss or negative impact (e.g. defining the appropriate loss level or some other measure of interest on the balance sheet of the financial institution such as capital ratios or funding resources). Institutions should understand and document in detail the drivers of risk (e.g. outputting the exact factor draws that had the most impact on the portfolio tail region), the key business lines and a clear and consistent narrative around weaknesses and the corresponding scenarios (e.g. about the underlying assumptions and sensitivity of the results to those assumptions over time) that cause the pre-defined outcomes and the events chain and the likely flow through (e.g. the most important factors may be mapped to macroeconomic variables according to the combinations for a given target loss/capital in a portfolio), identifying hidden vulnerabilities (e.g. hidden correlations and concentrations) and overlapping effects.",

Institutions should, where appropriate, use sensitivity analyses as a starting point for reverse stress testing, e.g. shifting one or more relevant parameters to some extreme to reach pre- defined outcomes. An institution should consider various reverse sensitivity analyses for credit risk (e.g. how many large customers would have to go into default before the loss absorbing capital is lost), market risk, liquidity risk (e.g. stress on deposits in the retail sector and 32 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INSTITUTIONS' STRESS TESTING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY circumstances that would empty the institution's liquidity reserves) and operational risk, among other risks, and a combination analysis where all risks are covered simultaneously. However, an institution should not primarily use a sensitivity analysis and simple metrics to identify the scenario relevant for the reverse stress test. The qualitative analysis should lead to the identification of the relevant scenario, combining expert judgement from different business areas, as thinking might be the most effective way to prevent a business model failure. A joint stressing of all relevant risk parameters using statistical aspects (e.g. volatility of risk factors consistent with historical observations supplemented with hypothetical but plausible assumptions) should be developed. The plausibility of the parameter shifts required to reach the pre-defined outcome gives a first idea about possible vulnerabilities in the institution. To assess the plausibility, historical (multivariate) probability distributions - adjusted, where deemed necessary, according to expert judgements - should, inter alia, be applied. Qualitative analyses and assessments, combining expert judgements from different business areas, should guide the identification of relevant scenarios.",

Such 'near-default' scenarios should identify and describe the point that would lead an institution's or a group's business model to become non-viable unless the recovery actions were successfully implemented. The scenarios should allow the estimation of results and the suitability of all the available recovery options. The terminology used in the description of recovery scenarios should help to determine which recovery options were tested under particular stress scenarios. The description should have a sufficient level of detail, through both a set of quantitative assumptions and a qualitative narrative, in order to determine whether or not the scenario is relevant for the institution and how severe it is. The events should be described in a logical sequence and the assumptions underlying the main drivers (e.g. net income, risk-weighted assets (RWAs), capital) should be laid down very clearly. The scenarios should also take into account a possible estimation of the 33 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INSTITUTIONS' STRESS TESTING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY cross-effects of executing different recovery plan options in the same stress scenario. The scenarios should also allow an understanding of how the events unfold by providing an appropriate timeline that makes it clear at which point in time certain actions will be developed (with implications for their credibility and feasibility).

Institutions should, where appropriate, recognise that certain elements of capital requirements, as well as the liquidity buffers, may be used in stressed conditions (e.g. elements of the combined buffer requirements as specified in Chapter 4 of Title VII of Directive 2013/36/EU).",
            "189. In addition to the general requirements related to institutions' stress testing programmes specified in these guidelines, stress tests used for ICAAP/ILAAP purposes should meet the following specific requirements: a) institutions should cover all material risk categories (and sub-categories) that the institutions are exposed to with regard to both on- and off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities in relation to all material portfolios or sectors/geographies, including relevant structured entities; b) a range of scenarios should be considered including at least an adverse economic scenario that is severe but plausible, such as a severe economic downturn and/or a market-wide and idiosyncratic shock to liquidity; c) ICAAP and ILAAP stress testing should be performed through comprehensive institution- wide stress testing and reflect all entities for which ICAAPs or ILAAPs are required; d) ICAAP and ILAAP stress tests should cover the same forward-looking period as the institution's ICAAP and ILAAP, respectively, and be updated at least as regularly as the ICAAP and ILAAP; ICAAP stress tests should cover a period of at least two years.",
            "190. ICAAP and ILAAP stress tests should be consistent with the risk appetite and overall strategy (i.e. including the business strategy) of the institution. Institutions should demonstrate a clear link between their risk appetite, their business strategy, and their ICAAP and ILAAP stress tests. In particular, institutions should assess their capital and liquidity plans, and any internal capital planning, including management capital buffers, consistent with their stated risk appetite and strategy, and overall internal capital needs, and rebuild their liquidity positions after using liquidity buffers to meet their liabilities during a stress period.",
            "191. Furthermore, in their ICAAP stress test, institutions should assess their ability to stay above applicable regulatory and supervisory capital requirements (e.g. total SREP capital requirements-TSCR) in stressed conditions. 48 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON INSTITUTIONS' STRESS TESTING EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY",
            "192. When doing solvency stress tests for the purposes of ICAAP, institutions should also consider the impact of scenarios on the institution's leverage ratio as well as eligible liabilities held for the purposes of minimum requirements for eligible liabilities (MREL).",
            "193. Supervisory stress testing conducted pursuant to Article 100 of Directive 2013/36/EU or the scenarios or assumptions prescribed to an institution as a result of supervisory challenges and assessments of institutions' own stress tests should not be seen as replacing the obligations of institutions to carry out stress tests as part of their ICAAPs and ILAAPs."

            "1. Executive summary Article 21b of Directive 2013/36/EU introduced a requirement for institutions belonging to third- country groups to have an intermediate EU parent undertaking (IPU) established in the Union, where the total value of assets in the Union of the third-country group is equal to or greater than EUR 40 billion. The EBA considers that a common methodology for calculating the total value of assets in the Union as well as consistent supervisory expectations are essential for ensuring consistent application of the IPU requirement. Therefore, in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010, the EBA decided to provide this necessary guidance to the institutions that are part of third-country groups operating in the Union and to the competent authorities responsible for supervision over the institutions and branches belonging to the third-country groups. Following the suggestion of the European Commission expressed in its letter to the EBA, the guidelines clarify the relevant dates for the calculation of the total value of the assets in the Union, taking into account the fluctuation in the value of assets. In particular, the guidelines specify that for the purpose of the application of the IPU requirement, the total value of assets in the Union of the third-country group should be calculated as an average over the last four quarters. This value should be monitored on a quarterly basis and communicated to relevant competent authorities. In order to meet the IPU requirement in a timely manner it is necessary that institutions belonging to third-country groups apply a forward-looking approach. It is therefore specified that they should assess at least annually whether the threshold is expected to be reached within the three-year horizon, based on the strategic planning of the third-country group and the forecast of assets. For the purpose of both the quarterly assessments and the annual forward-looking monitoring, institutions and branches belonging to a third-country group should exchange between each other all necessary information. In addition, these guidelines specify certain procedural aspects related to the monitoring of the threshold by competent authorities and the establishment of the IPU where necessary. In particular, clarification is provided on the notifications required by Article 21b(6) of Directive 2013/36/EU, namely that these are to be provided to the EBA on an annual basis. In addition, certain exceptional situations are specified where competent authorities may identify appropriate timelines for the establishment of an IPU, no longer than up to two years from reaching the threshold. Relevant competent authorities should coordinate and take necessary measures to ensure adequate implementation of the IPU requirement. 3 FINAL REPORT ON THE EBA GUIDELINES ON THE MONITORING OF THE IPU THRESHOLD EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY",

            "1. The Directive (EU) 2019/878 (CRD V) introduced in the prudential framework a requirement for certain third-country groups to have an intermediate EU parent undertaking (IPU), with a view to ensuring the consolidated supervision of the EU activities of such groups and facilitating the resolution of those activities.",
            "2. Article 21b of Directive 2013/36/EU requires that two or more institutions in the Union which are part of the same third-country group as defined in Article 3(1), point (64) of Directive 2013/36/EU, in the sense that these institutions are all subsidiaries of a parent undertaking established in a third country, have a single IPU that is established in the Union, where the combined total value of assets of the group in the Union is equal to or greater than EUR 40 billion (IPU threshold). The total value of assets in the Union includes the assets of any institutions belonging to the third-country group as well as any branches authorised to operate in the Union1. Under certain circumstances, in particular in the case of mandatory requirements for separation of activities imposed in some third countries, and subject to approval by competent authorities, it is allowed to set up two IPUs for a third-country group operating in the EU. Such possibility is granted under Article 21b(2) of Directive 2013/36/EU. However, regardless of whether a third-country group is subject to any requirements on separation of activities or not, the calculation of the IPU threshold remains the same and requires aggregation of financial information on all institutions and branches authorised in the Union and belonging to the same third-country group.",
            "3. The terms \"institution\", \"EU parent institution\" and \"parent undertaking\" should be understood as in Article 3(3) of Directive 2013/36/EU.",
            "4. As clarified in Article 21b(3) of Directive 2013/36/EU, the IPU may take the form of an authorised credit institution, or a financial holding company or a mixed financial holding company that has been granted approval in accordance with Article 21a of Directive 2013/36/EU. Where none of the institutions operating in the Union which are part of a third-country group is a credit institution, the IPU may take the form of an authorised investment firm. In addition, where a second IPU must be set up in connection with investment activities to comply with a mandatory requirement as referred to under Article 21b(2), point (a) of Directive 2013/36/EU, the second IPU may be an authorised investment firm."

For that purpose, the guidelines specify that the calculation is made by adding the assets of the EU parent institutions of that group consolidated in accordance with Article 18 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (prudential consolidation) at the highest level of consolidation in the Union to the individual assets of institutions that are not part of a group subject to consolidated supervision pursuant to Article 111 of Directive 2013/36/EU (\"stand-alone institutions\") and to the assets of the branches of that group referred to in Article 21b(5), point (b) of Directive 2013/36/EU. 5 EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY FINAL REPORT ON THE EBA GUIDELINES ON THE MONITORING OF THE IPU THRESHOLD",

            "12.To determine in a harmonised way where the threshold set out in Article 21b(4) of Directive 2013/36/EU has been reached having regard to the fluctuation in the value of assets, these guidelines clarify that the threshold is deemed as reached where the average of the total value of assets in the Union of a third-country group over the previous four quarters, equals or exceeds EUR 40 billion.",
            "13.Equally there is a need to specify in a prudent but proportionate way, having also regard to the need for financial stability in the Union, when the threshold set out in Article 21b(4) of Directive 2013/36/EU is deemed as no longer exceeded and the relevant institutions of the third-country group are relieved from their obligation to have an IPU established in the Union. To that end, these guidelines specify that the threshold is deemed as no longer exceeded, where the total value of assets in the Union of a third-country group remains below EUR 40 billion for twelve consecutive quarters and there are no reasonable expectations it will increase again above EUR 40 billion.",
            "14.Monitoring of the threshold by institutions that are part of a third-country group should be forward-looking, so that the institutions that are part of that group are able to perform their obligations under Article 21b of Directive 2013/36/EU when the threshold is exceeded. To that end, at least annually the threshold should be assessed against the strategic planning and the forecast of assets for the time horizon of at least three years for the group in its entirety (\"forward-looking monitoring\").",
            "15.These guidelines should also specify how institutions that are part of a third-country group should monitor the threshold set out in Article 21b(4) of Directive 2013/36/EU. It is therefore clarified that EU parent institutions and stand-alone institutions that are part of a third-country group should be the ones performing the relevant quarterly assessments and the annual forward-looking monitoring for the group as a whole. Upon their establishment the quarterly assessment should be performed by the IPUs only, and the forward-looking monitoring is no longer necessary.",
            "16.Having regard to the transitional provision set out in Article 21b(8) of Directive 2013/36/EU, it should be determined that the total value of assets in the Union of these third-country groups should be calculated on a point-in-time basis as at 27 June 2019 and not on the basis of any average. Where the value at that date is not available, the total value of assets as at 30 June 2019 should be used, as an approximation of the value as at 27 June 2019. Additionally, where Article 21b(8) of Directive 2013/36/EU applies, the threshold should be deemed as reached only where on 30 December 2023, the average of the total value of assets in the Union of the group over the previous four quarters equals or exceeds EUR 40 billion. 6 FINAL REPORT ON THE EBA GUIDELINES ON THE MONITORING OF THE IPU THRESHOLD EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY"

            "5. Accompanying documents Cost-benefit analysis A. Introduction Article 21b of Directive 2013/36/EU was introduced in the new banking package to require third- country groups with total activities in the EU above a certain threshold to establish an intermediate EU parent undertaking (IPU). According to Article 21b(1) and (4) of Directive 2013/36/EU, the threshold is set at the level of EUR 40 billion3. Therefore, third-country groups that account with two or more institutions in the Union and reach the threshold shall have an IPU. B. Policy objective The guidelines aim at providing clarity on the practical application of the IPU requirement for the third-country groups as well as the competent authorities supervising their branches and subsidiaries in the EU. In particular, the guidelines provide a common methodology for the calculation of the total value of assets to be compared with the IPU threshold. Such common methodology is crucial for achieving consistent application of Union law and the application of consolidated supervision to institutions based on the same criteria. Moreover, the guidelines entail other transparency policy objectives, related to the publication on the EBA website of a list of all third-country groups operating in the Union and their IPU. This transparency would ensure that market participants have clarity of the direct ownership of those institutions. C. Baseline scenario Paragraph (6) of the newly introduced Article 21b of Directive 2013/36/EU requires that competent authorities notify the EBA about: (i) the names and the total value of assets of supervised institutions belonging to a third-country group; (ii) the names and the total value of assets corresponding to branches authorised in the Member State and the types of activities that they are authorised to carry out; and (iii) the name and the type of any IPU set up in that Member State and the name of the third-country group of which it is part. Regarding the timeline, both addressees of the guidelines should comply with their obligations set out in CRD V. Member States should implement the changes to Directive 2013/36/EU by 29"
