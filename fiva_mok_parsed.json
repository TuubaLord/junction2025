                    "(1) Outsourcing is a way of arranging supervised entities' activities, covered by financial market regulation. By outsourcing, supervised entities may seek to increase the efficiency, flexibility and competitiveness of their operations. However, responsibility for outsourced activities remains with the supervised entity, and therefore supervised entities' internal control and risk management must also extend to outsourced activities. Supervised entities must send the FIN- FSA an advance notification of intentions to outsource material activities.",
                    "(2) These regulations aim at ensuring that outsourcing does not in any way impair the criteria for the supervised entity's authorisation and that the supervised entity's operations, also with respect to the outsourced activities, have been arranged so that they are in compliance with all obligations laid down in legal requirements and FIN-FSA regulations and guidelines for internal control and risk management.",
                    "(3) The purpose is also to ensure that outsourcing does not impair the possibilities of the supervised entity's management to direct and monitor activities or to obtain an overall picture of the supervised entity's risks. Supervised entities must be able to and capable of managing risks, irrespective of outsourcing.",
                    "(4) Furthermore, the purpose is to ensure that, in using outsourced information technology resources via so-called cloud services1, supervised entities ensure in particular that the risks involved with the services are managed, the continuity of the services is secured and that data protection is assured. (Issued on 4.11.2014, valid from 1.1.2015)",
                    "(5) These regulations and guidelines are designed to ensure that outsourcing does not impair FIN- FSA supervision and inspection of supervised entities' activities."

The area aR is approximated by first forming a bar between each 5% bucket, where the width of the horizontal axis represents the relative proportion of each bucket (here: 5%). The height of the bar indicates the average share of bad credits in these two buckets. For example, the width of the bar between the 5% and 10% score buckets is 5, and its height, on a rounded basis, is 14+26.5 = 20,2 (see Table 1 column \"Cumulative share of bad credits between groups on average, %\"). 2",

                    "(9) The EBA Guidelines on internal governance are based on the 'three lines of defence' model, which is discussed in particular under Title V on 'Internal control framework and mechanisms' of the EBA Guidelines. In accordance with the introduction to the Final Report on the EBA Guidelines, the tasks of the three lines of defence include the following: First line of defence The first line of defence refers to the business lines of the supervised entity. The business lines have processes and controls created for operational activities to ensure that business-related risks are identified, analysed and assessed, and that they are monitored, managed and reported to the management. The first line of defence is responsible for ensuring that business activities are pursued within the supervised institution's risk appetite defined by its management and that the business activities are compliant with external and internal requirements. Second line of defence The risk management function and compliance function form the second line of defence. The risk management function, as part of the second line of defence, facilitates the implementation of a sound risk management framework throughout the supervised entity and typically has responsibility for identifying, monitoring, analysing, measuring, managing and reporting its risks. It is tasked with forming a holistic view on the supervised entity's all risks on an individual and consolidated basis. It challenges and assists the first line of defence in the implementation of risk management measures by the business lines in order to ensure that the process and controls in place at the first line of defence are properly designed and effective. The compliance function typically monitors compliance with legal requirements and internal policies as well as provides support and advice on compliance to the supervised entity's management and other staff. Both the risk management and compliance function have a role in ensuring that the internal control and risk management methods applied within the first line of defence are modified where necessary. Third line of defence The third line of defence refers to an independent internal audit function. The internal audit function is responsible for conducting audits, among other things, to ascertain that governance arrangements, processes and mechanisms are sound, effective, implemented and consistently applied. The internal audit function is also in charge of the independent review of the first two lines of defence. GUIDELINE (paragraphs 10-14)",

The supervised entity may apply a risk-based approach in determining how to allocate resources to ensuring compliance with sanctions regulation and national freezing orders. However, in doing so it must be ensured that the supervised entity has adequate resources in all areas of its operation to ensure that sanctions regulation and national freezing orders are complied with in all respects. Risk-based discretion may not be applied as to whether the supervised entity complies with sanctions regulation and national freezing orders in all respects. Example 1: Based on a sanctions risk assessment prepared by a supervised entity, the supervised entity has assessed that the comprehensive sanctions imposed on Russia will have an effect elevating the risk associated with its activities. Applying a risk-based approach, the supervised entity allocates more resources on the areas of its operation which are the most vulnerable to sanctions imposed on Russia. Among other things, the supervised entity scrutinises Russian payment traffic on an enhanced basis (including the background and purpose of payments) with respect to customers that have payments to/ from Russia."

                    "(17) The FIN-FSA recommends supervised entities to consider that the annexes under sanctions regulation determine the competent authority in each member state which may grant derogations from the prohibitions referred to in the relevant sanctions regulation. In Finland, the competent authority is the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Example: Sanctions are imposed on a Finnish citizen, person X, in an EU sanctions regulation binding on Finland. Person X has a housing loan, amortised by monthly instalments to the bank. Person X also has home insurance, which is payable on a quarterly basis, and an investment policy paid on a monthly basis. Furthermore, X receives an employee pension. The abovementioned EU sanctions regulation enables the national competent authority to grant permission to unfreeze certain frozen funds or other economic resources or to make certain funds or economic resources available. The precondition is that the funds or economic resources are necessary to satisfy the basic needs of the sanctioned party. Basic needs include, among other things, payments for foodstuffs, rent or mortgage, medicines and medical treatment, taxes, insurance premiums, and public utility charges. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs has, at person X's application, granted person X a derogation to satisfy basic needs, which covers housing loan instalments and home insurance premiums. Before the bank takes receipt of a housing loan instalment, it checks the contents of the derogation presented by person X and saves it in customer's KYC-file. The insurance company also acts accordingly and accepts the home insurance premiums. In contrast, the investment insurance policy is excluded from the scope of the derogation, and the insurance company does not accept related payments. The employee pension company seeks a derogation from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs for the payment of employee pension. In connection with the payment of the pension, the employee pension company may also need to provide the derogation to its own bank so that the bank can ascertain that the funds may be transferred to the recipient of pension despite person X being subject to EU sanctions.

Contingency planning requirements should be taken into account already when outsourcing contracts are drawn up. Supervised entities subject to contingency planning requirements should evaluate contingency plans drawn up by external suppliers and ensure that they meet prevailing requirements. A supervised entity subject to contingency planning requirements should, for example, test an external supplier's contingency plan in joint trial runs with the supplier.",

YL is the proportion of a housing corporation's loan allocated to primary housing pledge, or the proportion of company loan unpaid in respect of the shares at the time of transfer of title. Other loans of the housing corporation not allocated to the shares and on which there is insufficient information for allocation at the time of granting credit, are not taken into account in the LTV calculation. MEL refers to other loans related to the primary housing pledge, which have similar or senior ranking relative to the loan being assessed. An MEL loan is related to an object being financed (for example, a renovation loan or finance for the purchase of an object).

If the guarantee is limited to a certain amount of euros, this amount is used. Unlimited guarantee meeting the requirements eliminates the liability. In this case, the LTV is zero. EAP refers to primary housing pledge. The euro amount used is the current value of the object being purchased, generally the transaction price, to which the housing loan is allocated. If the transaction price no longer corresponds to current value, the updated current value shall be used. MOAJ refers to other own housing pledges and secondary pledges on own housing pledges. OT refers to own deposit collateral. Nominal deposit amount. MR is the market value of own real collateral. VVP is received third-party pledges less credit and pledging encumbrances allocated to the pledge. If the pledge is limited to a certain euro amount, this amount is used. If the pledge is unlimited, the entire value of the pledge less liabilities with senior ranking is used. AP refers to a pledge encumbering a primary housing pledge, given to a third party for another loan of the borrower, related to another object than that being financed (eg consumer credit). (Issued on 6.6.2017, valid from 1.10.2017) TT is an institutional deficiency guarantee (granted by a sovereign state, insurance company or other credit institution), whose value is calculated in this context as max (0; coverage level - sum of primary collateral).

                    "(1) In accordance with section 24 of the MCBCBA, the total value of the cover pool shall continuously exceed the value of payment obligations arising from the covered bonds as provided in said section (overcollateralisation). The value of the overcollateralisation shall constantly be at least two per cent. If the requirements laid down in Article 129(3)(a)(3) of the EU Capital Requirements Regulation are not met, the overcollateralisation value shall be at minimum five per cent. In addition to the part laid down in this subsection, the overcollateralisation shall also cover the estimated winding-down costs related to covered bonds. The overcollateralisation amount shall be determined by a calculation method based on present value. When calculating the present value, payments of loan receivables included in the cover pool shall be taken into account in the proportion in which these loan receivables are included in the calculation of the cover pool total value as referred to in section 23 above. If the calculation method based on present value produces a higher cover pool total value than the method based on the nominal value of obligations incurred from the covered bonds, the overcollateralisation shall be determined on the basis of the nominal value. In calculations based on both the current and the nominal value, any increased credit loss risk of the secured receivable shall be appropriately accounted for, at least in cases where the receivable shall, pursuant to Article 178 of the EU Capital Requirements Regulation, be considered non-performing. In calculations based on the nominal value, the cover assets in the cover pool and the impact of currency derivatives contracts shall be taken into account when determining the obligations incurred from covered bonds. In calculations based on the present value, the value of derivatives contracts shall be determined on the basis of present value at the time of valuation. The same method shall be used to determine both the total value of the cover pool and the obligations incurred from the covered bonds. The Financial Supervisory Authority may issue further regulations on the valuation of derivatives and taking total cash flows into account when calculating cover pool total value. The Financial Supervisory Authority may also issue further regulations on the methods used to calculate and value overcollateralisation. REGULATION (paragraphs 2-3)",
                    "(2) In both nominal and present value-based calculation, the same method based on the fair value or book value, where lower than the fair value, shall be applied to the substitution assets referred to in section 18 of the MCBCBA and assets used to cover the liquidity buffer requirement under section 31 of the MCBCBA, which is applied to the determination of the liquidity buffer requirement under section 31 of the MCBCBA.",

In Finland, instruments qualifying for the list comprise shares with classes carrying entitlement to different voting rights, cooperative shares (osuus), non-voting shares (äänivallaton osuus) and basic fund shares (kantarahasto-osuus). Even if a CET1 instrument has the same legal form as an instrument mentioned in the EBA's list, the inclusion of new instruments into CET1 must be based either on a classification permission or the notification procedure under paragraph (2). Where an entirely new category of CET1 instrument is concerned, institutions should be prepared for a permission procedure lasting for several months, since the processing of a permission requires that an opinion is requested from the EBA.",
                    "(5) The EBA has published a report on CET1 instruments issued by institutions authorised in the EU (\"EBA report on the monitoring of CET1 instruments issued by EU institutions\").

The FIN-FSA recommends that the supervised entities contact the FIN-FSA well in advance and submit to the FIN-FSA planned criteria and a comparison of them to the criteria set in the CRR and the Commission Delegated Regulation 241/2014, which criteria the capital instruments must meet. One may refer for example to the \"Public Guidance on the review of the qualification of capital instruments as Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 instruments\" issued by the ECB's Banking Supervision. The Guidance is available on the website of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (bankingsupervision.europa.eu).",

                    "(13) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities determine items calculated as retail exposures as follows: · the conditions for retail exposures set out in Article 123 of the CRR are satisfied · the total exposures to one counterparty, referring both to an individual inhabitant and a group of connected clients, do not exceed 0.2% of the total retail exposures, and the supervised entity has ascertained that the retail exposure portfolio does not include sectoral or similar risk exposures.",
                    "(14) When a supervised entity is determining exposures belonging to the retail exposures in accordance with paragraph (13) applying the 0.2% threshold in line with the Basel recommendation, it can be considered sufficient that the supervised entity conducts the calculation on an annual basis based on the information of the last day of December. This entails that the supervised entity determines the total amount of exposures belonging to retail exposures taking into account Article 123, paragraphs a) and c) of the CRR and subsequently removes from this pool any exposures exceeding 0,2% of the total value of the portfolio and finds out any sectoral or similar exposures related to the portfolio. Any exposures qualifying for the portfolio after this shall be treated as retail exposures for the purposes of capital requirements calculation."

                    "(17) The FIN-FSA recommends that where the loan of a housing corporation is significant, the supervised entity also assesses the impact of this corporate loan as a factor impairing the value of the share. In determining the value of an individual apartment, the proportion of corporate loan related to the apartment should be deducted from the value of the shares accepted as collateral. The supervised entity should also pay specific attention to the repayment capacity of the owner of an individual apartment, if a corporate loan amounts to a considerable proportion of the collateral (more than 50% of debt-free value).",

Where it advises the holders of securities, the Board of Directors of the offeree company must present its view on the effects of implementation of the bid on employment, terms of employment and the locations of the company's places of business. c) The Board of Directors of an offeree company must act in the interests of the company as a whole and must not deny the holders of securities the opportunity to decide on the merits of the bid. d) False markets must not be created in the securities of the offeree company, of the offeror company or of any other company concerned by the bid in such a way that the rise or fall of the prices of the securities becomes artificial and the normal functioning of the markets is distorted. e) An offeror must announce a bid only after ensuring that it can fulfil in full any cash consideration, if such is offered, and after taking all reasonable measures to secure the implementation of any other type of consideration. f) An offeree company must not be hindered in the conduct of its affairs for longer than is reasonable by a bid for its securities."

                    "(7) In accordance with chapter 11, section 7 of the SMA, an offeror launching a takeover bid shall afford equivalent treatment to all holders of the securities of the offeree company referred to in section 1 (equivalent treatment). GUIDELINE (paragraphs 8-13)",
                    "(8) According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, the requirement of equivalent treatment in chapter 11, section 7 of the SMA requires that a takeover bid is made to all holders of securities in an offeree company who own the class of securities targeted in the takeover bid. However, a bid may also target only a specific class of securities.",
                    "(9) Where a bid targets all shares subject to public trading in a regulated market, FIN-FSA recommends that it is also extended to shares which are subscribed for before the closing of the offer period or are received on the basis of securities issued by the offeree company carrying entitlement to shares issued by it.",
                    "(10) The requirement of equivalent treatment also requires, according to FIN-FSA's interpretation, that the terms of the takeover bid are consistent. A restricted or conditional bid in itself does not put holders of securities in a nonequivalent position. Therefore, a bid may concern, for example, only a given proportion of securities held by the holders of securities, if the restriction is the same for all holders of securities. For example, if in a partial takeover bid, acceptances cover a larger amount of securities than the offeror has undertaken to purchase, acceptances shall be made as a rule so that the same relative proportion of securities is purchased from all holders of securities.

                    "(11) In assessing the implementation of equivalent treatment, according to FIN-FSA's interpretation, any agreements and arrangements between the offeror and holders of securities targeted by the bid are also taken into account, where they are connected with the takeover bid. Therefore, an offeror may not agree, for example, on any specific benefits to be extended to certain shareholders in share transactions preceding the takeover bid, where such benefits lead to effectively better consideration for these shareholders than that which is offered in the takeover bid.",
                    "(12) In situations where a limited liability company acquires its own shares by way of a takeover bid, the requirement of equivalent treatment is fulfilled according to FIN-FSA's interpretation in practice through the equivalence principle provided in chapter 1, section 7 of the Companies Act (624/2006).",
                    "(13) Issues concerning the requirement of equivalent treatment in relation to the consideration are addressed in more detail in chapter 7 of these regulations and guidelines."

In the assessment, importance is also placed on how longstanding the acting in concert is or on how long-term the impacts the acting in concert have on the offeree company.",

                    "(27) According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, acting in concert triggering an obligation to launch a bid does not generally comprise any agreement to vote in a certain manner in the context of an individual decision at a General Meeting of shareholders, such as the appointment of board members or participating in the activities of a nomination committee referred to in the Finnish Corporate Governance Code consisting of shareholders or representatives of shareholders. However, acting in concert may comprise an agreement to vote in a certain FINANSSIVALVONTA FINANSINSPEKTIONEN FINANCIAL SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY Issued 10.6.2013 Valid from 1.7.2013 until further notice 9/2013 Takeover bid and the obligation to launch a bid 13 (42) manner in the context of an individual decision at a General Meeting of shareholders, where the decision has a significant long-term impact on the offeree company or its ownership and voting right structure.",
                    "(28) For example, in listed companies with traditional family-ownership, it is normal that the family exercising control or significant influence in the company act in concert as referred to in chapter 11, section 5 of the SMA, even if the members may not have made a shareholders' agreement. In these situations, acting in concert has often begun even before the shares in the offeree company have been listed on a regulated market. In these situations, the obligation to launch a bid based on acting in concert only arises where the proportion of voting rights belonging to the persons acting in concert exceeds the bid threshold after the share of the company has been admitted to trading on a regulated market. 2",
                    "(29) According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, acting in concert generally also triggers the obligation to disclose major shareholdings under chapter 9, section 5-7 of the SMA.

In addition, any uncertainties related to the implementation of the takeover plans shall be disclosed.",

If the offeror has particular grounds to assume that the proposed arrangement will not be supported by a sufficient number of shareholders in a General Meeting, before the publication of the takeover bid - bearing in mind the provisions on the use of inside information - the offeror should also consider the position held by such shareholders whose consent is de facto needed to make decisions in a General Meeting of shareholders, regarding the anticipated takeover bid."

In order that the takeover bid does not disrupt the functioning of the offeree company for an unreasonably long period or disrupt the price formation of the securities of the offeree company, FIN-FSA recommends that the bid procedure is commenced within a reasonable period of the publication of the takeover bid.",
                    "(24) The reasonableness of the period depends, among other things, on the consideration offered in the bid. FIN-FSA recommends that the offer document and prospectus for the offering of securities, if any, is compiled and submitted for approval to the competent authority without delay. In voluntary cash bids, it may usually be considered a reasonable period if the bid procedure is commenced within a month of the publication of the takeover bid.",
                    "(25) FIN-FSA recommends that, at the time of disclosing the takeover bid, the offeror presents an estimate of when the bid procedure will commence. Any delay in commencing the bid procedure should always be justified when disclosing information related to the takeover bid.",

The time allowed for the acceptance of a takeover bid may not be less than three nor more than ten weeks. The time allowed for the acceptance of a takeover bid may, for a special reason, be more than ten weeks provided that the business operations of the offeree company are not hindered for longer than is reasonable. A notice of the closing of the takeover bid shall be given at least two weeks prior to the closure of the bid. GUIDELINE (paragraphs 28-32)",

In this case, the procedure for extension or suspension of the offer period shall be described in the terms of the offer.",
                    "(29) According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, the decision to extend the offer period shall be made and disclosed within the original offer period. If the fulfilment of a condition under the terms of the offer concerning the proportion of ownership or voting rights so requires, a decision on extension of the offer period may, however, be made and disclosed at the latest on the following day after the lapsing of the offer period.",
                    "(30) According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, the offer period may be extended either so that the offer period continues until further notice or so that it ends on a specified date, at least two weeks after the announcement of the extension of the offer period. If the validity of the bid is extended until further notice, information on the closing of the bid shall be disclosed in accordance with chapter 11, section 12, subsection 2 of the SMA, with at least two weeks' notice.",
                    "(31) According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, a specific reason to extend the offer period beyond ten weeks could be, for example, that there are particular hindrances to the implementation of the bid. If, for example, the implementation of the bid requires the permission of a competition authority, the offeror shall extend the offer period until the authority has processed the matter and the offeror has had the possibility to assess the impact of the conditions, if any, included in the permission of the competition authority, on the bid.",
                    "(32) According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, in a conditional takeover bid, the offeror may, according to international practice, extend the validity of the bid after the conditions of the offer have been fulfilled and the offer has turned unconditional and the first transactions to complete the bid have been made or the offeror has confirmed it will make them. In particular, this practice may improve retail investors' opportunities to react to the situation. The unconditionality of the bid may in this case constitute a reason of such a nature that it authorises the offeror to extend the offer period beyond ten weeks.

                    "(33) In accordance with chapter 11, section 12, subsection 3 of the SMA, FIN-FSA may, upon an application by the offeree company and, where necessary, without hearing the offeror, order that the time allowed for the acceptance of the takeover bid and the restriction set for the completion of the takeover bid, referred to in chapter 11, section 12, subsection 1 of the SMA, be extended so that the offeree company can convene the General Meeting of the Shareholders to consider the bid. Due to an extension, the offeror shall have the right to waive the bid within five banking days from being informed of the decision of the Financial Supervisory Authority. GUIDELINE (paragraphs 34-38)",
                    "(34) According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, the FIN-FSA decision on extension of the offer period may be appropriate, for example, where there is insufficient time otherwise to convene a General Meeting of the shareholders of the offeree company during the offer period to discuss the takeover bid. Correspondingly, a decision on extension of the offer period may be appropriate when it is justifiable to convene a General Meeting of the shareholders during the offer period due to issues arising during the offer period. Such issues may include, for example, a competing bid or a bid on an individual business function of the offeree company.",
                    "(35) Pursuant to the Companies Act, the management of the offeree company has the obligation to act with due care and promote the interests of the company. Therefore, FIN- FSA, as a rule, gives a decision to extend the offer period, where a General Meeting of the shareholders has been convened by an initiative of the Board of Directors or the Supervisory Council. In situations where the shareholders of the offeree company have required a convening of a General Meeting of the shareholders, FIN-FSA pays particular attention in its deliberations on the matters to be decided on by the General Meeting.",

Even a conditional bid is, pursuant to the Act on transactions on financial holdings (229/1929), binding on the offeror and the offeror may not waive the bid in other situations than those allowed by the law or where the conditions set for the implementation of the bid are not fulfilled.",
                    "(44) FIN-FSA recommends that the conditions set for the implementation of the takeover bid are unambiguous enough, such that the holders of the securities for which the bid is made could themselves assess the probability of their fulfilment. The fulfilment of the conditions should also be clearly verifiable, in order that the implementation of the bid would not in effect remain at the absolute discretion of the offeror. The conditions of the bid should also be reasonable so that the rights and obligations of the offeror as a whole would be balanced relative to the rights and obligations of the holders of the securities for which the bid is made.",
                    "(45) According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, chapter 11, section 8 of the SMA requires that the offeror does not invoke a condition set for the implementation of the bid unless the non- fulfilment of the condition has a material impact on the offeror from the perspective of the anticipated acquisition. FIN-FSA recommends that before invoking a condition set for the implementation of the bid, the offeror seeks, to the full extent possible, to contribute to the fulfilment of the conditions set for the implementation of the bid.",
                    "(46) According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, the restriction set for the completion of the takeover bid in chapter 11, section 12 of the SMA requires that securities in the book-entry system are placed on the book-entry account of the security holder who has accepted the bid or that the book-entries are segregated reliably until the conditional takeover bid is implemented. However, in this case it is possible to place a restriction on the disposal of these securities on the book-entry account of the security holder who has accepted the FINANSSIVALVONTA FINANSINSPEKTIONEN FINANCIAL SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY Issued 10.6.2013 Valid from 1.7.2013 until further notice 9/2013 Takeover bid and the obligation to launch a bid 22 (42) bid, or the book entries can be segregated for example by using converted shares, if this has been indicated in the terms of the offer.",

At the same time, the first offeror may also revise the terms of its bid in accordance with chapter 11, section 15 of the SMA.

Disclosure of the intention to disclose a competing bid does not, according to FIN-FSA's interpretation, lead to the application of the provisions on a competing bid.",
                    "(53) Pursuant to chapter 11, section 17 of the SMA, the publication of a competing bid triggers the obligation to supplement the offer document of the first bid. The right provided to FIN- FSA in chapter 11, section 11, subsection 4 of the SMA to require the offer period of the first bid to be extended by a maximum of ten banking days is generally necessary in the context of competing bids, so that the holders of securities in the offeree company who have accepted the first bid have sufficient time to consider the cancellation of their acceptance and the Board of Directors of the offeree company has time to supplement their statement on the first bid. Therefore, FIN-FSA will, as a rule, require extension of the offer period of the first bid so that it remains valid for at least ten banking days after the publication of the supplementation of the offer document.",

Where the first takeover bid has been made on the basis of the obligation to launch a bid, the offeror has no right to decide on the lapsing of its takeover bid.",

                    "(2) In accordance with chapter 11, section 21 of the SMA, if the securities resulting in the exceeding of the bid threshold have been acquired by a takeover bid launched for all the shares of the offeree company and for securities entitling thereto issued by the offeree company or otherwise during the time allowed for acceptance of such takeover bid, the obligation to launch a mandatory bid shall, however, not arise. If the securities resulting in the exceeding of the bid threshold have otherwise been acquired by a takeover bid, the obligation to launch a mandatory takeover bid shall not arise until the voting rights attached to the securities acquired by a takeover bid have been transferred to the offeror. If there is one shareholder in the offeree company whose proportion of voting rights exceeds the bid threshold, the obligation to launch a mandatory bid shall not arise upon another shareholder until his proportion of voting rights exceeds the proportion of voting rights of the first-mentioned shareholder. If the exceeding of the bid threshold results solely from measures taken by the offeree company or by another shareholder, the obligation to launch a mandatory takeover bid shall not arise before the shareholder who has exceeded the bid threshold acquires, or subscribes to, more shares of the offeree company or otherwise raises his proportion of voting rights in the offeree company. If the exceeding of the bid threshold results from the shareholders acting in concert upon launching a voluntary takeover bid for the offeree company, the obligation to launch a mandatory takeover bid shall not arise if the acting in concert is restricted solely to the launching of the takeover bid. The obligation to launch a mandatory takeover bid shall no longer exist if the party obliged to launch a bid or another person acting in concert reduces the proportion of voting rights exceeding the bid threshold by disposing of shares in the offeree company or by otherwise reducing its proportion of voting rights in the offeree company, within one month from the FINANSSIVALVONTA FINANSINSPEKTIONEN FINANCIAL SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY Issued 10.6.2013 Valid from 1.7.2013 until further notice 9/2013 Takeover bid and the obligation to launch a bid 26 (42) arising of the obligation to launch a bid. In order to be exempted from the obligation to launch a bid, the party obliged to launch a bid and the persons acting in concert may not, during that time, exercise voting rights in the offeree company. The party obliged to launch a bid shall, in addition, make public its intention to reduce the proportion of voting rights exceeding the bid threshold in connection with the disclosure of the arising of the obligation to launch a bid. Information on the falling of the proportion of voting rights below the bid threshold shall be made public without delay.",

                    "(5) Pursuant to chapter 11, section 19 of the SMA, the obligation to launch a bid concerns all shares of the offeree company, regardless of whether the share is subject to trading on a regulated market or not. In addition to the shares of the offeree company, the obligation to launch a bid concerns all securities issued by the offeree company carrying entitlement to its shares referred to in chapter 2, section 1 of the SMA. These include, for example, subscription rights, convertible bonds, option rights and other special rights to shares. Other securities issued by the offeree company which can be exchanged for or converted to shares of the offeree company, according to their terms of issue, belong in the scope of the obligation to launch a bid. According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, such securities referred to in chapter 2, section 1 of the SMA, also include securities subject to a temporary restriction on transfer. In addition to securities referred to in chapter 2, section 1 of the SMA, an offeror may, according to FIN-FSA's interpretation, extend a takeover bid to other rights issued by the offeree company carrying entitlement to its shares.",
                    "(6) Pursuant to chapter 11, section 19 of the SMA, the shareholder's obligation to launch a bid arises at the same time as its proportion of voting rights in the offeree company exceeds the bid threshold. Where the obligation to launch a bid arises on the basis of a takeover bid, the obligation to launch a bid arises pursuant to chapter 11, section 21, subsection 1, only after the completion of the takeover bid is made. As a rule, the obligation to launch a bid arises separately after exceeding the 30 and 50 per cent thresholds. According to FIN- FSA's interpretation, in other situations than those referred to in chapter 11, section 21, subsection 5 of the SMA, the obligation to launch a bid remains, even if the shareholder's proportion, after exceeding the bid threshold, falls below it.",
                    "(7) The point of departure of the takeover bid provisions of the SMA is a single-phase bid process. Therefore, an obligation does not arise on an offeror, pursuant to chapter 11, section 21, subsection 1 of the SMA, after a voluntary takeover bid in a situation where a voluntary bid is made for all shares in the offeree company and securities, referred to in chapter 2, section 1 of the SMA, issued by the offeree company and carrying entitlement to"

The consideration for such option rights is subject to the provisions in chapter 7.3 of these regulations and guidelines on the consideration in a mandatory takeover bid for such option rights.",
                    "(9) Correspondingly, pursuant to chapter 11, section 21, subsection 1 of the SMA, the obligation to launch a bid does not arise again in a situation where a mandatory takeover bid has been launched as a consequence of exceeding the 30 per cent threshold, and the 50 per cent threshold is exceeded through a mandatory takeover bid, or otherwise during the offer period. However, the obligation to launch a bid arises pursuant to chapter 11, section 19 of the SMA, where the proportion of the offeror, as a result of a voluntary or mandatory takeover bid, remains below 50 per cent of the voting rights in the offeree company, and the offeror subsequently acquires shares so that the 50 per cent threshold is exceeded. The obligation to launch a bid also arises when a voluntary takeover bid is made, for example, only for shares issued by the offeree company but not for securities issued by the offeree company carrying entitlement to its shares.",

Therefore, an obligation to launch a bid arises generally in a situation where the voting rights of shareholders acting in concert are transferred entirely to a single shareholder or in situations where shares are transferred to another company belonging to the same group.",
                    "(11) Similarly, according to FIN-FSA's interpretation, an obligation to launch a bid generally arises when the control, referred to in chapter 2, section 4 of the SMA, shifts within an entity whose voting rights in a company subject to public trading exceeds the threshold for obligation to launch a bid.",

According to FIN- FSA's interpretation, shares referred to in chapter 11, section 20, subsection 1, paragraph 4 of the SMA, do not include shares with which an agent of the shareholder participates in a General Meeting of the shareholder, if he only votes according to instructions provided by the shareholder."

                    "(20) Particular reasons for granting an exemption from the obligation to launch a bid could include at least one of the following: a) The proportion of voting rights exceeding the threshold for an obligation to launch a bid is not effectively transferred, for example, when transferring holdings to an entity or foundation within the same sphere of control. b) The proportion of voting rights exceeding the threshold for an obligation to launch a bid is transferred through an inheritance, as referred to in chapter 1, section 1 of the Inheritance Code, or in another manner to the persons referred to in chapter 2 of the Inheritance Code (succession). c) The proportion of voting rights exceeding the threshold for an obligation to launch a bid is exceeded on the basis of a share issue based on preferential rights of the shareholders, where the other shareholders have not used their preferential subscription right in full. d) The proportion of voting rights exceeding the threshold for an obligation to launch a bid is exceeded in a corporate transaction where the consideration comprises shares in the offeree company. e) The proportion of voting rights exceeding the threshold for an obligation to launch a bid is exceeded due to an underwriting commitment related to a share issue. f) The proportion of voting rights exceeding the threshold for an obligation to launch a bid is exceeded by an arrangement whose purpose is to secure the continuity of an offeree company in financial difficulty.",
                    "(21) Unless the position of minority shareholders has been secured sufficiently by way of other measures, an exemption from the obligation to launch a bid under section 20, subsections d-f above is contingent upon a decision on the arrangement by a General Meeting of the shareholders of the offeree company. In this case, the offeree company must disclose sufficient information on the anticipated arrangement before the General Meeting of the shareholders. In the General Meeting of the shareholders deciding on the arrangement, shareholders of the offeree company, who are independent of the arrangement, must support the arrangement by a majority of at least two thirds of the votes cast.",

In this situation, FIN-FSA pays special attention, in its consideration, to granting an exemption on the mutual independence of the shareholders acting in concert and to considering whether the shareholders acting in concert had increased their proportion of voting rights before they began to act in concert.

In this case, the premium paid for different classes of securities should generally be proportionately the same. However, the assessment should also account for the liquidity of the different classes of securities.

                    "(12) In accordance with chapter 11, section 23 of the SMA, with regard to a mandatory takeover bid, the consideration shall be an equitable price. A consideration in the form of securities or a consideration in the form of a combination of securities and cash may be offered as an alternative to a cash consideration. In determining an equitable price, the starting point shall be the highest price for the shares subject to the bid, paid during the six months preceding the arising of the obligation to launch a bid, by the party obliged to launch a bid or by a person acting in concert with him. Such price may be derogated from for a special reason. If the party obliged to launch a bid or a person acting in concert with him has not, within the six months prior to the arising of the obligation to launch a bid, acquired securities subject to the bid, the starting point for the determination of an equitable price shall be deemed to be the average of the prices paid for the securities subject to the bid in trading on a regulated market, weighted by the volume of the trade. Such price may be derogated from for a special reason. The party obliged to launch a bid and a person acting in concert with him shall notify the Financial Supervisory Authority of the shares in the offeree company and the securities issued by the offeree company carrying entitlement to the shares he has acquired during the 12 months preceding the arising of the obligation to launch a takeover bid as well as between the arising of the obligation to launch a bid and the close of the takeover bid and the considerations paid thereof. GUIDELINE (paragraphs 13-16)",
                    "(13) According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, in assessing the highest price paid, direct securities purchases are comparable to derivatives agreements and securities as well as other contractual arrangements, by which the offeror or a party acting in concert with it acquires shares in the offeree company or a right to use voting power attached to the shares.

                    "(14) A consideration is determined separately for each class of shares and securities carrying entitlement to shares subject to the takeover bid. According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, the requirement of equivalent treatment in chapter 11, section 7 of the SMA, requires that the considerations offered for different classes of securities are in a reasonable and equitable proportion to each other. The bases used to determine the fair price are presented, pursuant to section 8, subsection 1, paragraph 1 of the MFC, by security class in the offer document.",
                    "(15) Option rights where the strike price for subscribing to shares exceeds the consideration payable for the shares have time value as long as there is some subscription period remaining. According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, chapter 11, section 23, requires that a cash consideration shall also be offered for such option rights. However, the consideration must be in a reasonable and equitable proportion to other securities subject to the takeover bid. Where the payment of a cash consideration, for example due to the shortness of the subscription period remaining or a considerable difference between the consideration payable for the share and the strike price, would lead to an unreasonable outcome from the viewpoint of the holders of other securities or the offeror, it is possible to derogate from the obligation to pay a cash consideration.",
                    "(16) The provision on a trade-volume weighted average over three months is, according to chapter 11, section 23, subsection 3, applicable only in a situation where the party obliged to launch a bid has not, during the six past months, acquired shares in the offeree company. Such a situation could arise for example when the party obliged to launch a bid has acquired control in an entity whose voting rights in a publicly traded company exceeds the threshold for the obligation to launch a bid, or when the obligation to launch a bid has arisen as a result of acting in concert."

                    "(18) In the context of reviewing the offer document, FIN-FSA assesses whether the consideration offered fulfils the requirements of the SMA. FIN-FSA's assessment is based on an overall assessment. The assessment takes into account, among other things, the general principles of chapters 1 and 11 of the SMA and Article 3 of the Takeover Bids Directive. In its assessment, FIN-FSA may also take into account a statement, if any, by a body referred to in chapter 11, section 28, on the consideration.",
                    "(19) According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, situations where the implementation of equivalent treatment may require an increase of the minimum consideration from the general minimum consideration, they may, include the following: · The consideration paid or offered for another class of securities in the offeree company is not in a reasonable and equitable proportion to the consideration offered for another class of securities.

                    "(20) In assessing the justifications to derogate downwards from the starting point for the determination of an equitable price, FIN-FSA takes into account, among other things, the following: · the time of previous securities purchases, the size of individual purchases and the proportion of the consideration paid to the market price of the security prevailing at the time of purchase · the position of the Board of Directors of the offeree company regarding derogating from the minimum consideration · whether the securities acquired at a higher price have been acquired from the management of the offeror or the offeree company or other parties closely related with the offeror or the offeree company · the total number of shares purchased during the six months preceding the arising of the obligation to launch a bid."

                    "(26) FIN-FSA's interpretations presented in chapter 7.5 on the valuation principles of a securities-based consideration are primarily applicable to situations where a security given as consideration is subject to trading in a regulated market supervised by an authority. The valuation principles are applied, as applicable, also to other situations where cash consideration has to be compared to a security consideration.",
                    "(27) According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, continuous fluctuation of the value of the consideration is an integral part of the nature of a securities-based consideration. Functioning corporate acquisition market require that the offeror can, already in launching a voluntary takeover bid, assess the costs incurring from an acquisition with considerable certainty. In addition, the reliable price formation of the securities of the offeree company requires that the parties have a clear conception of how an acquisition of securities beyond the scope of the takeover bid will affect the consideration offered or to be offered in the takeover bid.",

The verification of identity after the establishment of customer relationship may be justified for example in the context of non-life insurance involving risk that the customer would be otherwise unable to obtain an urgently needed insurance.

The simplified procedure enables the adjustment of customer due diligence procedures and one, several, or all individual customer due diligence actions and ongoing customer monitoring actions.

The simplified procedure does not have to be similar in all low-risk circumstances.",
                    "(158) According to the FIN-FSA's interpretation, compliance with the simplified customer due diligence procedure as referred to in chapter 3, section 8 of the AML Act requires that the supervised entity has specifically assessed whether the customer or individual transaction involves such risk factor due to which the customer or transaction should not be classified as low-risk. In order that the supervised entity could make this assessment, it shall obtain adequate information on the customer and the nature and extent of its business. The assessment shall not be based on any single risk factor, but the customer relationship and the risk factors involved shall be considered as a whole.",
                    "(159) According to the FIN-FSA's interpretation, based on chapter 3, section 8 of the AML Act, customers can be grouped so that a group of customers involving low risk is subject to a similar customer due diligence procedure. However, the application of a simplified customer due diligence procedure requires that there are no such considerations that would elevate the ML/TF risk related to an individual customer relationship in a way that, when assessed as a whole, the risk associated with the customer relationship could no longer be considered low. FIN-FSA FINANCIAL SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY Regulations and guidelines 2/2023 Issued 22.5.2023 Valid from 26.6.2023 until further notice FIN A S FIN FIN CIN S A 53 (87) For example, this kind of customer groups which could be subject to a simplified customer due diligence procedure if the customer relationship does not involve special risk-elevating considerations, include: · a limited liability housing company whose primary purpose is to own and control apartments possessed by the shareholders · a private road maintenance association only engages in private road maintenance activities · a joint ownership association managing a common water area only engaging in water area management and activities customarily related to fishing in it · a ditch drainage corporation established by landowners, only engaged activities related to the execution of joint ditch drainage and maintenance.",
                    "(160) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities reflect on the following questions in assessing whether the housing company customers referred to above in paragraph 159 involve any special characteristics that would elevate the associated ML/TF risk: . Does the housing company use the supervised entity's products and services in a manner typical of housing companies? · Does the housing company pursue leasing of commercial premises to a significant extent, and if it does, do the tenants involve risk-elevating characteristics for example due to operating in fields typically associated with higher money laundering risk (for example a company whose business involves many large cash payments)? · Is the supervised entity aware that there is an elevated money laundering risk related to a member of the board of the housing company or an owner holding a significant proportion of the housing company's shares?",
                    "(161) According to the FIN-FSA's interpretation, the application of a simplified due diligence procedure as refer to in chapter 3, section 8 of the AML Act does not free the supervised entity from carrying out ongoing monitoring in accordance with chapter 3, section 4(2) of the AML Act. The supervised entity shall observe and pay attention to such changes in the customer's circumstances or activities, based on which the customer can no longer be considered a low-risk customer and thereby within the scope of the simplified customer due diligence procedure.",
                    "(162) The FIN-FSA recommends that, in preparing simplified customer due diligence procedures, supervised entities take into account the following possibilities to ease the customer due diligence procedure: · The supervised entity carries out the customer due diligence procedures to update customer due diligence information less frequently in comparison with normal or above-normal-risk customers. · The supervised entity does not specifically obtain information on the purpose of the customer relationship, since this can be deduced based on the type of product or service used by the customer, where the product or service concerned has been designed for a single purpose and the product or service type does not involve high risk in itself. . The supervised entity carries out ongoing monitoring of the customer and customer relationship on a more limited scale than with higher-risk customers, for example adjusting the frequency and intensity of ongoing monitoring. Ongoing monitoring may also be adjusted by only monitoring transactions above a certain threshold. However, when applying a threshold, FIN-FSA FINANCIAL SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY Regulations and guidelines 2/2023 Issued 22.5.2023 Valid from 26.6.2023 until further notice S C FIN FIN FIN CIN A 54 (87) the supervised entity shall ensure that the threshold is set at a reasonable level and the system is able to identify linked transactions whose combined value would exceed the threshold."

                    "(29) The FIN-FSA recommends that supervised entities consider, in circumstances referred to above in paragraph 27, the measures described in guideline 4.10 of the ESMA Risk Factors Guidelines to mitigate risks where a customer has legitimate and credible reasons for being unable to provide traditional forms of identity documentation. Such measures could include, for example: - adjusting the level and intensity of monitoring in a way that is commensurate to the ML/TF risk associated with the customer, including the risk that a customer who may have provided a weaker form of identity documentation may not be who they claim to be; and FIN-FSA FINANCIAL SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY Regulations and guidelines 2/2023 Issued 22.5.2023 Valid from 26.6.2023 until further notice FIN S C FIN FIN CIN A 72 (87) - offering only basic financial products and services, which restrict the ability of users to abuse these products and services for financial crime purposes. Where such basic products and services are concerned, it may also be easier for firms to identify unusual transactions or patterns of transactions, including the unintended use of the product. However, it is important that all restrictions are proportionate and do not unduly or unnecessarily limit customers' access to financial products and services.",
                    "(30) An application example related to FIN-FSA guidelines 27 and 28 above: A supervised entity has had a longstanding customer relationship with a private customer. According to the supervised entity's assessment, the customer relationship does not involve elevated risk of money laundering or terrorist financing. In establishing the customer relationship - and potentially also several times during the customer relationship - the supervised entity has verified the identity of the private customer, but this data has not been retained in a manner compliant with the AML Act or the data has been lost, for example in connection with systems changes made by the supervised entity. The supervised entity has requested the private customer to re-verify identity in accordance with chapter 3, section 2(1)(4) of the AML Act. However, the private customer is in a care facility and no longer has a valid proof of identity that could be used for the verification of identity, and due to health reasons has no possibility to visit the supervised entity in person. Neither does the private customer have the means to verify identity using strong electronic identification methods. The supervised entity has detected in ongoing monitoring that the customer's transactions are ordinary and often also regularly recurring (such as regular pension income and care facility charges). If restrictive measures would lead to an undue denial of access to financial services by the private customer, and the restrictive measures could not be regarded as necessary from the perspective of total risk associated with the customer relationship based on the supervised entity's risk assessment, when taking into account the customer's justified and credible reasons for not being able to re-verify identity, the implementation of restrictive measures would not be due and commensurate. In these circumstances, the supervised entity shall assess, instead of restrictive measures, the level of risk that would arise if the verification of identity has not been renewed and take measures that are sufficient and commensurate to manage the risk.
