            "(4) According to the FIN-FSA's interpretation, ensuring the effective policies, procedures and internal control referred to in chapter 3, section 16 of the AML Act requires that the supervised entity has first prepared a risk assessment, in which it identifies and assesses the risks of non-compliance with sanctions regulation and national freezing orders it is exposed to, as well as their probabilities.",
            "(5) According to the FIN-FSA's interpretation, the effective policies, procedures and internal control referred to in chapter 3, section 16 of the AML Act shall be commensurate with the risks identified in the risk assessment. The supervised entity may apply a risk-based approach in determining how to allocate resources to ensuring compliance with sanctions regulation and national freezing orders. However, in doing so it must be ensured that the supervised entity has adequate resources in all areas of its operation to ensure that sanctions regulation and national freezing orders are complied with in all respects. Risk-based discretion may not be applied as to whether the supervised entity complies with sanctions regulation and national freezing orders in all respects. Example 1: Based on a sanctions risk assessment prepared by a supervised entity, the supervised entity has assessed that the comprehensive sanctions imposed on Russia will have an effect elevating the risk associated with its activities. Applying a risk-based approach, the supervised entity allocates more resources on the areas of its operation which are the most vulnerable to sanctions imposed on Russia. Among other things, the supervised entity scrutinises Russian payment traffic on an enhanced basis (including the background and purpose of payments) with respect to customers that have payments to/ from Russia."

            "(17) The FIN-FSA recommends supervised entities to consider that the annexes under sanctions regulation determine the competent authority in each member state which may grant derogations from the prohibitions referred to in the relevant sanctions regulation. In Finland, the competent authority is the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Example: Sanctions are imposed on a Finnish citizen, person X, in an EU sanctions regulation binding on Finland. Person X has a housing loan, amortised by monthly instalments to the bank. Person X also has home insurance, which is payable on a quarterly basis, and an investment policy paid on a monthly basis. Furthermore, X receives an employee pension. The abovementioned EU sanctions regulation enables the national competent authority to grant permission to unfreeze certain frozen funds or other economic resources or to make certain funds or economic resources available. The precondition is that the funds or economic resources are necessary to satisfy the basic needs of the sanctioned party. Basic needs include, among other things, payments for foodstuffs, rent or mortgage, medicines and medical treatment, taxes, insurance premiums, and public utility charges. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs has, at person X's application, granted person X a derogation to satisfy basic needs, which covers housing loan instalments and home insurance premiums. Before the bank takes receipt of a housing loan instalment, it checks the contents of the derogation presented by person X and saves it in customer's KYC-file. The insurance company also acts accordingly and accepts the home insurance premiums. In contrast, the investment insurance policy is excluded from the scope of the derogation, and the insurance company does not accept related payments. The employee pension company seeks a derogation from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs for the payment of employee pension. In connection with the payment of the pension, the employee pension company may also need to provide the derogation to its own bank so that the bank can ascertain that the funds may be transferred to the recipient of pension despite person X being subject to EU sanctions.

The calculation must state that it is not a promise of future returns or capital accumulation, nor a binding disclosure of the expenses to be charged but rather it has been complied to facilitate the assessment and comparison of the agreements available. The calculation must also state that the figures presented may only realise provided that the instalment and investment plans assumed in the calculation are followed, the return estimates realise and the expenses charged on the agreement and the investments do not change during the agreement period.",

If the offeror has particular grounds to assume that the proposed arrangement will not be supported by a sufficient number of shareholders in a General Meeting, before the publication of the takeover bid - bearing in mind the provisions on the use of inside information - the offeror should also consider the position held by such shareholders whose consent is de facto needed to make decisions in a General Meeting of shareholders, regarding the anticipated takeover bid."

Legal actions, whereby the holding or voting rights attached to the shares offered to be sold in the takeover bid are transferred to the offeror in accordance with the terms of the takeover bid (completion of the takeover bid), may not be taken before at least three weeks have elapsed from the time allowed for acceptance of the takeover bid. The time allowed for the acceptance of a takeover bid may not be less than three nor more than ten weeks. The time allowed for the acceptance of a takeover bid may, for a special reason, be more than ten weeks provided that the business operations of the offeree company are not hindered for longer than is reasonable. A notice of the closing of the takeover bid shall be given at least two weeks prior to the closure of the bid. GUIDELINE (paragraphs 28-32)",
            "(28) The offeror determines, within the scope of the provisions of chapter 11, section 12 of the SMA, the duration of the offer period. According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, within the terms of the offer, it is possible to reserve the possibility to extend or suspend the offer period. In this case, the procedure for extension or suspension of the offer period shall be described in the terms of the offer.",
            "(29) According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, the decision to extend the offer period shall be made and disclosed within the original offer period. If the fulfilment of a condition under the terms of the offer concerning the proportion of ownership or voting rights so requires, a decision on extension of the offer period may, however, be made and disclosed at the latest on the following day after the lapsing of the offer period.",
            "(30) According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, the offer period may be extended either so that the offer period continues until further notice or so that it ends on a specified date, at least two weeks after the announcement of the extension of the offer period. If the validity of the bid is extended until further notice, information on the closing of the bid shall be disclosed in accordance with chapter 11, section 12, subsection 2 of the SMA, with at least two weeks' notice.",
            "(31) According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, a specific reason to extend the offer period beyond ten weeks could be, for example, that there are particular hindrances to the implementation of the bid. If, for example, the implementation of the bid requires the permission of a competition authority, the offeror shall extend the offer period until the authority has processed the matter and the offeror has had the possibility to assess the impact of the conditions, if any, included in the permission of the competition authority, on the bid.",
            "(32) According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, in a conditional takeover bid, the offeror may, according to international practice, extend the validity of the bid after the conditions of the offer have been fulfilled and the offer has turned unconditional and the first transactions to complete the bid have been made or the offeror has confirmed it will make them. In particular, this practice may improve retail investors' opportunities to react to the situation. The unconditionality of the bid may in this case constitute a reason of such a nature that it authorises the offeror to extend the offer period beyond ten weeks. After the first FINANSSIVALVONTA FINANSINSPEKTIONEN FINANCIAL SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY Issued 10.6.2013 Valid from 1.7.2013 until further notice 9/2013 Takeover bid and the obligation to launch a bid 20 (42) transactions to complete the bid have been made and the offer period has been extended, FIN-FSA recommends that such completion transactions are made at regular intervals, for example every two weeks. 5.3.3 FIN-FSA decision on extension of the offer period",
            "(33) In accordance with chapter 11, section 12, subsection 3 of the SMA, FIN-FSA may, upon an application by the offeree company and, where necessary, without hearing the offeror, order that the time allowed for the acceptance of the takeover bid and the restriction set for the completion of the takeover bid, referred to in chapter 11, section 12, subsection 1 of the SMA, be extended so that the offeree company can convene the General Meeting of the Shareholders to consider the bid. Due to an extension, the offeror shall have the right to waive the bid within five banking days from being informed of the decision of the Financial Supervisory Authority. GUIDELINE (paragraphs 34-38)",
            "(34) According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, the FIN-FSA decision on extension of the offer period may be appropriate, for example, where there is insufficient time otherwise to convene a General Meeting of the shareholders of the offeree company during the offer period to discuss the takeover bid. Correspondingly, a decision on extension of the offer period may be appropriate when it is justifiable to convene a General Meeting of the shareholders during the offer period due to issues arising during the offer period. Such issues may include, for example, a competing bid or a bid on an individual business function of the offeree company.",
            "(35) Pursuant to the Companies Act, the management of the offeree company has the obligation to act with due care and promote the interests of the company. Therefore, FIN- FSA, as a rule, gives a decision to extend the offer period, where a General Meeting of the shareholders has been convened by an initiative of the Board of Directors or the Supervisory Council. In situations where the shareholders of the offeree company have required a convening of a General Meeting of the shareholders, FIN-FSA pays particular attention in its deliberations on the matters to be decided on by the General Meeting.",
            "(36) FIN-FSA recommends that the offeree company applies for a decision on the extension of the offer period without undue delay. The application shall describe the matters to be addressed by the General Meeting of the shareholders.",
            "(37) If the offeror does not waive the takeover bid, the decision on extension of the offer period shall be binding on the offeror, pursuant to chapter 11, section 12, subsection 3.",
            "(38) According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, information on a decision to extend the offer period or to waive the bid shall be disclosed and communicated in a similar manner to a decision on a takeover bid."

            "(18) In accordance with chapter 11, section 31 of the SMA, FIN-FSA may issue further regulations on the grounds for granting the exemptions, referred to in chapter 11, section 26 of the SMA. These regulations are presented in paragraphs 19-23, below. REGULATION (paragraphs 19-22)",
            "(19) The consideration for granting an exemption is based on an overall assessment. The assessment takes into account, for example, the general principles laid down in chapters 1 and 11 of the SMA, the general principles of Article 3 of the Takeover Bids Directive as well as the impact of the exemption on the effective position of minority shareholders FINANSSIVALVONTA FINANSINSPEKTIONEN FINANCIAL SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY Issued 10.6.2013 Valid from 1.7.2013 until further notice 9/2013 Takeover bid and the obligation to launch a bid 29 (42) Whether the minority shareholders of the offeree company have been aware of the arrangement in advance and been able to influence its content are also taken into account, when considering an exemption.",
            "(20) Particular reasons for granting an exemption from the obligation to launch a bid could include at least one of the following: a) The proportion of voting rights exceeding the threshold for an obligation to launch a bid is not effectively transferred, for example, when transferring holdings to an entity or foundation within the same sphere of control. b) The proportion of voting rights exceeding the threshold for an obligation to launch a bid is transferred through an inheritance, as referred to in chapter 1, section 1 of the Inheritance Code, or in another manner to the persons referred to in chapter 2 of the Inheritance Code (succession). c) The proportion of voting rights exceeding the threshold for an obligation to launch a bid is exceeded on the basis of a share issue based on preferential rights of the shareholders, where the other shareholders have not used their preferential subscription right in full. d) The proportion of voting rights exceeding the threshold for an obligation to launch a bid is exceeded in a corporate transaction where the consideration comprises shares in the offeree company. e) The proportion of voting rights exceeding the threshold for an obligation to launch a bid is exceeded due to an underwriting commitment related to a share issue. f) The proportion of voting rights exceeding the threshold for an obligation to launch a bid is exceeded by an arrangement whose purpose is to secure the continuity of an offeree company in financial difficulty.",
            "(21) Unless the position of minority shareholders has been secured sufficiently by way of other measures, an exemption from the obligation to launch a bid under section 20, subsections d-f above is contingent upon a decision on the arrangement by a General Meeting of the shareholders of the offeree company. In this case, the offeree company must disclose sufficient information on the anticipated arrangement before the General Meeting of the shareholders. In the General Meeting of the shareholders deciding on the arrangement, shareholders of the offeree company, who are independent of the arrangement, must support the arrangement by a majority of at least two thirds of the votes cast.",
            "(22) A particular reason for an exemption from the obligation to launch a bid may also be that the mandatory bid threshold is exceeded in a situation where mutually independent shareholders begin to act in concert in order to exercise control in the offeree company. In this situation, FIN-FSA pays special attention, in its consideration, to granting an exemption on the mutual independence of the shareholders acting in concert and to considering whether the shareholders acting in concert had increased their proportion of voting rights before they began to act in concert. GUIDELINE (paragraphs 23-25)",
            "(23) An exemption may be granted permanently or for a fixed period. When an exemption is granted for a fixed period, the party receiving the exemption must reduce its holdings within a specified period under the bid threshold or, if the circumstances have changed FINANSSIVALVONTA FINANSINSPEKTIONEN FINANCIAL SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY Issued 10.6.2013 Valid from 1.7.2013 until further notice 9/2013 Takeover bid and the obligation to launch a bid 30 (42) materially, apply for a new exemption. Conditions may also be set for an exemption. Such a term could be, for example, that the recipient of the exemption may not increase its proportion of voting rights in the offeree company.",
            "(24) An exemption may be applied for before exceeding the bid threshold, on the condition that anticipated arrangement is implemented. An application for an exemption, and a decision on it, are in these cases secret, pursuant to the Act on the openness of government activities, until the anticipated arrangement has been disclosed. However, according to FIN-FSA's interpretation, if an exemption is applied for only after exceeding the proportion of voting rights triggering the obligation to launch a bid, the arising of the bid obligation must be disclosed in accordance with chapter 11, section 22 of the SMA. According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, in this case, an exemption must be applied for without delay after the arising of the obligation to launch a bid.",
            "(25) Unless secrecy provisions require otherwise, FIN-FSA will publish any exemptions from the obligation to launch a bid on its website. Where an exemption has been applied for on condition of the implementation of an anticipated arrangement, the exemption shall be disclosed only after the anticipated arrangement has been disclosed."

            "(18) In the context of reviewing the offer document, FIN-FSA assesses whether the consideration offered fulfils the requirements of the SMA. FIN-FSA's assessment is based on an overall assessment. The assessment takes into account, among other things, the general principles of chapters 1 and 11 of the SMA and Article 3 of the Takeover Bids Directive. In its assessment, FIN-FSA may also take into account a statement, if any, by a body referred to in chapter 11, section 28, on the consideration.",
            "(19) According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, situations where the implementation of equivalent treatment may require an increase of the minimum consideration from the general minimum consideration, they may, include the following: · The consideration paid or offered for another class of securities in the offeree company is not in a reasonable and equitable proportion to the consideration offered for another class of securities.

            "(20) In assessing the justifications to derogate downwards from the starting point for the determination of an equitable price, FIN-FSA takes into account, among other things, the following: · the time of previous securities purchases, the size of individual purchases and the proportion of the consideration paid to the market price of the security prevailing at the time of purchase · the position of the Board of Directors of the offeree company regarding derogating from the minimum consideration · whether the securities acquired at a higher price have been acquired from the management of the offeror or the offeree company or other parties closely related with the offeror or the offeree company · the total number of shares purchased during the six months preceding the arising of the obligation to launch a bid."

The enhanced procedure may include, for example, the following measures: · obtaining information from the customer's place of birth · obtaining more detailed information from sources other than the customer · obtaining additional information on the customer, such as the purpose and intended nature of the customer relationship · obtaining information on the customer's wealth and the source of funds · verifying identity on the basis of reliable and independent sources · carrying out the customer due diligence more frequently than normal throughout the customer relationship · conducting a regular review of the customer's transactions · obtaining more detailed information on the customer's business · obtaining additional information on the customer's beneficial owners and beneficiaries · examining the customer's previous business activities · researching the customer and its beneficial owners for example through an online search · obtaining senior management's approval for the establishment or continuation of the customer relationship.",

In these circumstances, the supervised entity is obliged to apply enhanced customer due diligence in order to manage the higher-than-normal ML/TF risks."
