For example, the provision of financial services may involve prohibitions or restrictions under sanctions regulation. In particular, in the context of trade finance services, it is necessary to ensure that the transactions are not violating sanctions regulation and do not seek to evade sanctions regulation. Example: A supervised entity provides an export letter of credit for a customer's transaction related to Kazakhstan. The supervised entity's customer exports goods to its new customer in Kazakhstan. The goods have been determined as dual-use items, and their exports to Russia are prohibited under valid sanctions regulation. The supervised entity must ensure that the transaction does not directly or indirectly involve sanctioned parties and that the transaction does not seek to evade sanctions regulation in any other way, for example so that the ultimate recipient of the goods is in Russia.31",

                        "(5) According to the FIN-FSA's interpretation, the effective policies, procedures and internal control referred to in chapter 3, section 16 of the AML Act shall be commensurate with the risks identified in the risk assessment. The supervised entity may apply a risk-based approach in determining how to allocate resources to ensuring compliance with sanctions regulation and national freezing orders. However, in doing so it must be ensured that the supervised entity has adequate resources in all areas of its operation to ensure that sanctions regulation and national freezing orders are complied with in all respects. Risk-based discretion may not be applied as to whether the supervised entity complies with sanctions regulation and national freezing orders in all respects. Example 1: Based on a sanctions risk assessment prepared by a supervised entity, the supervised entity has assessed that the comprehensive sanctions imposed on Russia will have an effect elevating the risk associated with its activities. Applying a risk-based approach, the supervised entity allocates more resources on the areas of its operation which are the most vulnerable to sanctions imposed on Russia. Among other things, the supervised entity scrutinises Russian payment traffic on an enhanced basis (including the background and purpose of payments) with respect to customers that have payments to/ from Russia."

                        "(17) The FIN-FSA recommends supervised entities to consider that the annexes under sanctions regulation determine the competent authority in each member state which may grant derogations from the prohibitions referred to in the relevant sanctions regulation. In Finland, the competent authority is the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Example: Sanctions are imposed on a Finnish citizen, person X, in an EU sanctions regulation binding on Finland. Person X has a housing loan, amortised by monthly instalments to the bank. Person X also has home insurance, which is payable on a quarterly basis, and an investment policy paid on a monthly basis. Furthermore, X receives an employee pension. The abovementioned EU sanctions regulation enables the national competent authority to grant permission to unfreeze certain frozen funds or other economic resources or to make certain funds or economic resources available. The precondition is that the funds or economic resources are necessary to satisfy the basic needs of the sanctioned party. Basic needs include, among other things, payments for foodstuffs, rent or mortgage, medicines and medical treatment, taxes, insurance premiums, and public utility charges. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs has, at person X's application, granted person X a derogation to satisfy basic needs, which covers housing loan instalments and home insurance premiums. Before the bank takes receipt of a housing loan instalment, it checks the contents of the derogation presented by person X and saves it in customer's KYC-file. The insurance company also acts accordingly and accepts the home insurance premiums. In contrast, the investment insurance policy is excluded from the scope of the derogation, and the insurance company does not accept related payments. The employee pension company seeks a derogation from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs for the payment of employee pension. In connection with the payment of the pension, the employee pension company may also need to provide the derogation to its own bank so that the bank can ascertain that the funds may be transferred to the recipient of pension despite person X being subject to EU sanctions.

Definitions (para. 11) Gender pay gap Some respondents noted that the definition of gender pay gap does not take into account the type of work, level of responsibility or experience, thus this definition is insufficient to meet the purpose of having gender-neutral remuneration policies and also differs from the 'equal pay for equal work or work of equal value'. In addition, it is proposed to replace the term 'earnings' with 'remuneration'; and the term 'hourly' with 'full-time annual remuneration awarded' or 'monthly/yearly remuneration' or 'gross annual remuneration'. In addition, it is proposed to link this definition with the methodology defined in section 2.5 In line with work published by the European Parliament39, the gender pay gap is the difference in average gross hourly earnings between women and men. It is based on salaries paid directly to employees before income tax and social security contributions are deducted. Calculated this way, the gender pay gap does not take into account all the different factors that may play a role, for example education, hours worked, type of job, career breaks or part-time work. The gender pay gap indicates more than just the difference in hourly or annual gross remuneration for the same job (which should not be different at all), but provides information on how successfully equal opportunities have been provided within society and within the institution. The GL were amended to replace unclear terms. GL amended",
