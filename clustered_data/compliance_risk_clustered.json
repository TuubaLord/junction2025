The objective of the definition of 'connected clients' in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 is to identify clients so closely linked by idiosyncratic risk factors that it is prudent to treat them as a single risk. Idiosyncratic risk represents the effect of risks that are specific to individual clients. Idiosyncratic risk arises where, in a bilateral interrelationship, financial problems of one entity are transferred via this interrelationship to another entity that otherwise would not be concerned. Consequently, the purpose of these guidelines is to clarify and operationalise the concept of interconnection, in particular when control issues or economic dependency should lead to the grouping of clients because they constitute a single risk in accordance with Article 4(1)(39) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.",

It is distinct from criminal or administrative infringement procedures. Institutions have to ensure that members of the management body and key function holders are suitable for their respective roles. When concerns have been raised, it is up to the institution to demonstrate that the individual meets reputation, honesty and integrity standards. In this respect, competent authorities are also required to verify whether the suitability requirements under CRD and MiFID as further specified in these Guidelines are still fulfilled where they have reasonable grounds to suspect 14 FINAL REPORT ON GUIDELINES ON THE ASSESSMENT OF THE SUITABILITY OF MEMBERS OF THE MANAGEMENT BODY AND KEY FUNCTION HOLDERS esma European Securities and Markets Authority EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY that money laundering or terrorist financing is being or has been committed or attempted, or there is increased risk thereof in connection with that institution.",

Involvement of an institution in money laundering and terrorist financing might have an impact on its viability and the trust in the financial system. Directive (EU) 2015/849 (AMLD), in line with international standards for the prevention of money laundering and countering terrorist financing (AML/CFT) set by the Financial Action Task Force, stresses the importance of senior management taking responsibility for the identification, assessment and management of ML/TF risks and requires, without prejudice to the national transposition of Directive 2015/849/EU, institutions to identify the member of the management board7 who is responsible for the implementation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with AMLD.",

Together with competent authorities responsible for ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering requirements under Directive (EU) 2015/849 (AML Supervisors) and other relevant bodies (such as Financial Intelligence Units), competent authorities have an important role to play in identifying and tackling weaknesses in institutions' AML/CFT systems and controls. In this context, the Guidelines clarify in line with Directive 2013/36/EU that the knowledge, experience and skill requirements of at least the member of the management body who is responsible for the implementation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with AMLD include identifying, managing and mitigating money laundering and financing of terrorism risk. The Guidelines also clarify that the ability to understand ML/TF risks is part of the assessments of the collective suitability of the members of the management body and the assessment of key function holders."

Definitions (para. 11) Gender pay gap Some respondents noted that the definition of gender pay gap does not take into account the type of work, level of responsibility or experience, thus this definition is insufficient to meet the purpose of having gender-neutral remuneration policies and also differs from the 'equal pay for equal work or work of equal value'. In addition, it is proposed to replace the term 'earnings' with 'remuneration'; and the term 'hourly' with 'full-time annual remuneration awarded' or 'monthly/yearly remuneration' or 'gross annual remuneration'. In addition, it is proposed to link this definition with the methodology defined in section 2.5 In line with work published by the European Parliament39, the gender pay gap is the difference in average gross hourly earnings between women and men. It is based on salaries paid directly to employees before income tax and social security contributions are deducted. Calculated this way, the gender pay gap does not take into account all the different factors that may play a role, for example education, hours worked, type of job, career breaks or part-time work. The gender pay gap indicates more than just the difference in hourly or annual gross remuneration for the same job (which should not be different at all), but provides information on how successfully equal opportunities have been provided within society and within the institution.

                        "1. Executive summary Directive 2014/59/EU1, establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions, investment firms and related entities (the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive, or BRRD) specifies a Union-wide framework for crisis prevention, management and resolution of these entities. These guidelines have been developed by the EBA, in close cooperation with the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), pursuant to Article 5(7) of the BRRD, and specify the range of scenarios of severe macroeconomic and financial distress which should be considered by institutions to test the effectiveness of recovery options and the adequacy of the indicators contained in their recovery plans. The objective of a recovery plan is not to forecast the factors that could prompt a crisis, but rather to identify the actions that might be available to counter those factors and to assess whether they are robust enough and their nature is sufficiently varied to cope with a wide range of shocks of different natures. For this purpose, the scenarios of severe macroeconomic and financial distress should be designed in a way that they would threaten the failure of an institution or group if recovery measures were not implemented in a timely manner. However, given that the aim of a recovery plan is to prove the capacity to restore the viability of an institution, these scenarios should be designed as 'near-default' situations; i.e. they should bring an institution close to failure but no further. This element should be taken into consideration for example when considering using reverse stress testing to identify the most appropriate scenarios. The guidelines stipulate that at least three scenarios of severe macroeconomic and financial distress should be included to ensure coverage of a system-wide event, an idiosyncratic event and a combination of system-wide and idiosyncratic events. In line with the principle of proportionality, global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs) and other systemically important institutions (O-SIIs) identified pursuant to Article 131 of the CRD should include at least four scenarios. The guidelines recognise that the risks that each institution faces vary significantly according to its business and funding model, its activities and structure, its size or its interconnectedness to other institutions or to the financial system in general. Moving from this premise, to ensure that recovery plans are tested against the main types of system-wide and idiosyncratic events, the guidelines identify the specific factors and events that should be taken into account in determining the appropriate scenarios. These factors have been selected as those that most typically threaten the failure of institutions or groups. However, the overriding principle remains 1 Directive 2014/59/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms and amending Council Directive 82/891/EEC, and Directives 2001/24/EC, 2002/47/EC, 2004/25/EC, 2005/56/EC, 2007/36/EC, 2011/35/EU, 2012/30/EU and 2013/36/EU, and Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010 and (EU) No 648/2012, (OJ L 173, 12.6.2014, p.190). 3 RUNNING TITLE COMES HERE IN RUNNING TITLE STYLE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY that the scenarios should be based on the events and factors that are the most relevant to the institution or group. Hence, different events should be used where those are more relevant. On this basis and in line with the provisions of the BRRD on the assessment of recovery plans and the related technical standards pursuant to Article 6(8), competent authorities will assess the adequacy of the scenarios chosen by the banks. The EBA launched a public consultation on 20 May 2013 (EBA/CP/2013/09) on the guidelines. The decision behind this early consultation stage was to allow phasing of the delivery of the large number of technical standards/guidelines that the EBA is required to produce as mandated by the BRRD. By the time the consultation was launched, the EBA was mandated to develop technical standards for the range of scenarios to be used by firms to test their recovery plans. Following the change of the mandate, the draft technical standards have been transposed to fit the structure of the guidelines, whilst also taking into account the feedback received from respondents during the consultation period. The comments received from stakeholders have been considered. Comments, the EBA's analysis and any consequent changes to the guidelines are reported in the feedback table at the end of this paper. The guidelines are structured into three titles. The first title establishes the subject matter and scope of the guidelines. Title 2 provides design principles for the range of scenarios and the range of scenarios to be considered. Finally, Title 3 determines when the guidelines take effect. 4 RUNNING TITLE COMES HERE IN RUNNING TITLE STYLE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY",
                        "2. Background and rationale At the international level, any initiatives on recovery and resolution planning are carried out under the auspices of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), which in its Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions2 identifies the essential elements of recovery and resolution plans, and recommends recovery and resolution plans to be in place at least for any financial institution that could be systemically significant or critical if it fails. At the EU level, co-legislators have adopted Directive 2014/59/EU (the BRRD), establishing a recovery and resolution framework in the European Union. The EBA has developed these guidelines in accordance with the mandate contained in Article 5(7) of the BRRD, which mandates the EBA to develop guidelines to specify the range of scenarios of severe macroeconomic and financial distress to be used to assess the arrangements that institutions have in place and the measures that would be adopted to maintain or restore the institutions' viability in a timely manner. Rationale and regulatory approach followed in the GL The BRRD stipulates in Article 5(6) that the competent authorities should ensure that firms test their recovery plans against a range of scenarios of severe macroeconomic and financial distress, varying in their severity, including system-wide events, legal entity-specific stress and group-wide stress, while Article 7(6) requires group recovery plans to include a range of recovery options specifying actions to address those scenarios. At the same time Article 5(7) of the BRRD mandates the EBA to develop, in close cooperation with the ESRB, guidelines specifying the range of scenarios to be used for the purposes of Article 5(6). Following this mandate, these guidelines are prepared taking into account the FSB Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions, the FSB Guidance on Recovery Triggers and Stress Scenarios, and current supervisory practices. The guidelines cover the key elements and essential issues that should be addressed by institutions when developing severe macroeconomic and financial distress scenarios against which the recovery plan will be tested. Drafting a recovery plan is incumbent upon institutions or groups and is to be undertaken prior to a crisis in order to assess the potential options that an institution or a group could itself implement to restore financial strength and viability should the institution or group come under severe stress. Recovery plans must be based on the assumption that extraordinary public financial support would not be provided. Financial institutions are responsible for drafting and owning their own plans, but they will be assessed by the relevant competent authority or authorities."

Executive Summary Article 84(6) of the Directive 2013/36/EU1 (Capital Requirements Directive - CRD) mandates the EBA to issue Guidelines to specify the criteria for the evaluation by an institution's internal system of the interest rate risk of an institution's non-trading book activities (IRRBB) as well as the criteria for the identification, management and mitigation by institutions of the IRRBB either if it implements internal systems, the standardised approach or the simplified standardised approach. The EBA published in July 2018 Guidelines \"on the management of interest rate risk arising from non-trading book activities\" (\"the 2018 Guidelines\") that apply from June 2019 with dedicated provisions on these aspects. The current Guidelines replace the 2018 EBA Guidelines as some of its parts will be covered by dedicated RTS and the amended mandate includes new aspects as explained below. These new Guidelines maintain continuity with the previous Guidelines as far as possible, while updating some elements. The Guidelines are broadly consistent with the Basel standards with some further elaborated sections following the CRD mandate, particularly on CSRBB assessment and monitoring and non- satisfactory IRRBB internal systems. The EBA is mandated to specify in these Guidelines additional criteria for the assessment and monitoring by institutions of their credit spread risk arising from their non-trading book activities (CSRBB). The Guidelines provide a definition and the scope of application of CSRBB. They contain dedicated sections for CSRBB with specific provisions on the identification, assessment and monitoring of CSRBB. Finally, the mandate requests the inclusion of criteria for determining whether the internal systems implemented by institutions for the purpose of evaluating IRRBB are not satisfactory, in which case a competent authority may require an institution to use the standardised methodology. After some general provisions, the Guidelines contain separate specific chapters for IRRBB and for CSRBB. Next steps The guidelines will be translated into the official EU languages and published on the EBA website. The deadline for competent authorities to report whether they comply with the guidelines will be two months after the publication of the translations. Upon publication of these Guidelines, the 2018 Guidelines are repealed and replaced.

The supervised entity may apply a risk-based approach in determining how to allocate resources to ensuring compliance with sanctions regulation and national freezing orders. However, in doing so it must be ensured that the supervised entity has adequate resources in all areas of its operation to ensure that sanctions regulation and national freezing orders are complied with in all respects. Risk-based discretion may not be applied as to whether the supervised entity complies with sanctions regulation and national freezing orders in all respects. Example 1: Based on a sanctions risk assessment prepared by a supervised entity, the supervised entity has assessed that the comprehensive sanctions imposed on Russia will have an effect elevating the risk associated with its activities. Applying a risk-based approach, the supervised entity allocates more resources on the areas of its operation which are the most vulnerable to sanctions imposed on Russia. Among other things, the supervised entity scrutinises Russian payment traffic on an enhanced basis (including the background and purpose of payments) with respect to customers that have payments to/ from Russia."

The decision behind such an early consultation stage was to allow the delivery of the large number of technical standards/guidelines that the EBA is required to produce as mandated by the BRRD to be phased.",

                        "37. By the time the consultation was launched, Article 5(7) of the BRRD mandated the EBA to develop technical standards for the range of scenarios to be used by firms to test their recovery plans. The following summary and table are composed on the basis of the feedback received for the draft technical standards, although the mandate was subsequently changed to require guidelines in the legislative procedure. Following the change to the mandate, the draft technical standards were transposed to fit the structure of guidelines, whilst also taking into account the feedback received from respondents during the consultation period. Summary of key issues and the EBA's response In total, sixteen (16) responses were received; two (2) respondents asked for their response not to be published but the remainder were published on the EBA website. On the whole, the respondents welcomed the proposals and the efforts to harmonise the practices with scenarios that are being used to test the recovery plans. Many of the respondents welcomed the emphasis that scenarios should be used to test the recovery plan and to facilitate its assessment and the ability of the group to recover, rather than building recovery plans around a given set of scenarios. Some of the respondents considered the proposals too detailed or prescriptive to fit individual institutions, advocating more flexibility. It was considered that 'over-engineered' scenarios may create a ranking or hierarchy of recovery options for each particular scenario. Furthermore, recovery plans need to be tailor-made for each institution/group and appropriately reflect its specificities. The range of respondents' views was quite wide as far as the testing of the recovery plans on the group or individual level was concerned. Some respondents claimed that scenarios should be developed and tested at group level only, while others replied that they have already developed scenarios to test recovery plans both at individual and group level and considered these as useful. Some respondents argued that it is important to focus only on a few scenarios that are truly relevant to the institutions. This view was endorsed in particular in those cases when the respondent was supporting testing at group level only. 15 RUNNING TITLE COMES HERE IN RUNNING TITLE STYLE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY One issue that was raised in many replies related to the suggestion to adopt reverse stress testing as a tool for identifying scenarios that would threaten to cause the failure of the institution. Some respondents considered this to be a useful tool, whereas others considered the additional value of reverse stress testing of scenarios to be of minor significance. Some respondents considered that the proposals do not cover coordination between home/host authorities, which may give rise to significant additional costs for banks resulting from the preparation of local recovery plans. One respondent requested clarification on whether and how the 'simplified obligations' for smaller and simpler institutions are to be applied in the context of recovery plans. 16 RUNNING TITLE COMES HERE IN RUNNING TITLE STYLE EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY"

Directive (EU) 2015/849 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing requires that credit or financial institutions have in place policies, controls and procedures to mitigate and manage effectively the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF). In accordance with Article 8(4) of this Directive, where appropriate with regard to the size and nature of the business, credit or financial institutions have to appoint a compliance officer at the management level. Article 46(4) further provides that credit or financial institutions that have a management body also identify the member of the management body who is ultimately responsible for the implementation of the law, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with AML/CFT requirements.",

                        "7. In 2017, in its Supranational Risk Assessment, the European Commission asked the ESAs to develop guidance to clarify the role of AML/CFT compliance officers in credit or financial institutions. At the time, the ESAs considered that existing guidelines on internal governance were sufficient to fulfil the Commission's request.",
                        "8. There have, however, been a number of reports that suggest that the requirements set out in Directive (EU) 2015/849 have been implemented unevenly across different sectors and Member States, and that they are not always applied effectively. This can have adverse consequences for the integrity of the EU's financial system.",
                        "9. For example, a) In their 2017 Joint Opinion on the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing affecting the Union's financial sector1, the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) considered that the Union's financial sector was exposed to money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risks arising from ineffective AML/CFT systems and controls. Findings from national supervisors pointed to a number of causes for these shortcomings. These included senior management of some credit or financial institutions affording low priority to AML/CFT issues, in particular when paired with a corporate culture that pursues profits at the expense of robust compliance. This lack of senior management buy-in meant that ensuring adequate resources and hiring suitably qualified staff for AML/CFT roles were not seen as a priority, which appeared to affect the quality of financial institutions' AML/CFT controls. 1 JC/2017/07 of 20 February 2017 4 FINAL REPORT AND GUIDELINES ON THE ROLE OF THE AML/CFT COMPLIANCE OFFICER EBA EUROPEAN BANKING AUTHORITY b) The 2019 Report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the assessment of recent alleged money laundering cases involving EU credit institutions2 found that many credit institutions in the Commission's sample had not established adequate risk management systems and controls. The analysis revealed deficiencies in credit institutions' anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism-related governance arrangements (including the 'three lines of defence'), their internal reporting, group policies and senior managements' responsibilities and accountability. c) The EBA found in its 2019/2020 AML/CFT reviews of competent authorities' approaches to the AML/CFT supervision of banks3 that AML/CFT supervisors in some Member States did not interact with financial institutions' senior management because there was no legal or regulatory requirement in those Member States to appoint an AML/CFT compliance officer at a level that was sufficiently senior to report to the financial institution's senior management body. As a result, in those Member States there was a risk that AML/CFT supervision may not be effective. d) The EBA noted in its 2021 Opinion on the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing affecting the European Union's financial sector4 that there was still a sizeable proportion of competent authorities that considered that the quality of some controls had remained poor and many competent authorities identified persisting deficiencies in some key controls.

Through these guidelines, the EBA aims to achieve a common understanding, by competent authorities and credit or financial institutions, of the role and responsibilities of a. the AML/CFT compliance officer; and b. the management body with regard to AML/CFT or the senior manager where no management body exists.",
                        "11.A common understanding of the role and responsibilities of AML/CFT compliance officers and the management body or senior manager, which is applied and enforced consistently, is important to ensure that credit or financial institutions in all Member States implement sound and effective AML/CFT systems and controls and to protect the EU's financial sector from financial crime.

Therefore a more proportionate approach is taken for such investment firms, in particular regarding the establishment of committees and control functions. Most investment firms that are now subject to the governance provisions under the IFD have been subject to the requirements under the CRD, and consistency should therefore be ensured to the extent possible to reduce the implementation costs for such firms and to ensure that consistent group-wide policies can be applied.",

Institutions should set up an independent and effective internal audit function (IAF), taking into account the proportionality criteria set out in Title I, and should appoint a person to be responsible for this function across the entire institution. The IAF should be independent and have sufficient authority, stature and resources. In particular, the institution should ensure that the qualification of the IAF's staff members and the IAF's resources, in particular its auditing tools and risk analysis methods, are adequate for the institution's size and locations, and the nature, scale and complexity of the risks associated with the institution's business model, activities, risk culture and risk appetite.",

Each entity within the group should fall within the scope of the IAF.",

The IAF should verify, in particular, the integrity of the processes ensuring the reliability of the institution's methods and techniques, and the assumptions and sources of information used in its internal models (e.g. risk modelling and accounting measurements). It should also evaluate the quality and use of qualitative risk identification and assessment tools and the risk mitigation measures taken.",

The purpose of business continuity management is to reduce the operational, financial, legal, reputational and other material consequences arising from a disaster or extended interruption to these resources and consequent disruption to the institution's ordinary business procedures. Other risk management measures might be intended to reduce the probability of such incidents or to transfer their financial impact to third parties (e.g. through insurance).",

In order to establish a sound business continuity management plan, an institution should carefully analyse risk factors for and its exposure to severe business disruptions and assess (quantitatively and qualitatively) their potential impact, using internal and/or external data and scenario analysis.

Institutions' management, including key function holders, should contribute to the internal communication of core values and expectations to staff. Staff should act in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations and promptly escalate observed non-compliance within or outside the institution (e.g. to the competent authority through a whistleblowing process). The management body should on an ongoing basis promote, monitor and assess the risk culture of the institution; consider the impact of the risk culture on the financial stability, risk profile and robust governance of the institution; and make changes where necessary. b. Accountability: relevant staff at all levels should know and understand the core values of the institution and, to the extent necessary for their role, its risk appetite and risk capacity. They should be capable of performing their roles and be aware that they will be held accountable for their actions in relation to the institution's risk-taking behaviour. c. Effective communication and challenge: a sound risk culture should promote an environment of open communication and effective challenge in which decision- making processes encourage a broad range of views, allow for testing of current practices, stimulate a constructive critical attitude among staff, and promote an environment of open and constructive engagement throughout the entire organisation. d. Incentives: appropriate incentives should play a key role in aligning risk-taking behaviour with the institution's risk profile and its long-term interest33."

(Issued on 30.5.2024, valid from 27.6.2024)",
                        "(34) The supervised entity shall have procedures in place to ensure that it screens, before executing a transaction, valid sanctions lists based on sanctions regulation and investigates whether (i) the transaction involves parties subject to sanctions regulation or parties owned for more than 50% or controlled by such parties, and (ii) whether the provision of service related to the transaction is against the sanctions regulation, and, where necessary, refrain from the execution of the transaction or provision of service.",
                        "(35) Whenever technically possible with a view to the supervised entity's activities and the nature of its products and services, the supervised entity shall specify which data fields in the payment shall be screened against the sanctions lists. GUIDELINE (paragraphs 36-39)",
                        "(36) The FIN-FSA recommends that regulations 32-35, as applicable, are also complied with by supervised entities excluded from the authority to issue regulations under paragraph 30.",
                        "(37) According to the FIN-FSA's interpretation, the regulation referred to in paragraph 34 entails that before the provision of service, the supervised entity must carefully review prohibitions and restrictions due to sanctions regulation concerning the provision of service by the supervised entity (so-called sectoral sanctions). For example, the provision of financial services may involve prohibitions or restrictions under sanctions regulation. In particular, in the context of trade finance services, it is necessary to ensure that the transactions are not violating sanctions regulation and do not seek to evade sanctions regulation. Example: A supervised entity provides an export letter of credit for a customer's transaction related to Kazakhstan. The supervised entity's customer exports goods to its new customer in Kazakhstan. The goods have been determined as dual-use items, and their exports to Russia are prohibited under valid sanctions regulation. The supervised entity must ensure that the transaction does not directly or indirectly involve sanctioned parties and that the transaction does not seek to evade sanctions regulation in any other way, for example so that the ultimate recipient of the goods is in Russia.31",
                        "(38) The FIN-FSA recommends that, in sanctions screening concerning payments and other transactions, the supervised entity applies enhancement lists used in addition to official sanctions lists, naming for example parties that are owned for more than 50% or controlled by sanctioned parties.",
                        "(39) The FIN-FSA recommends that the supervised entity's sanctions screening of payments and transactions covers address information in addition to names, so that any countries and geographical areas subject to comprehensive sanctions can be identified."

                        "(17) The FIN-FSA recommends supervised entities to consider that the annexes under sanctions regulation determine the competent authority in each member state which may grant derogations from the prohibitions referred to in the relevant sanctions regulation. In Finland, the competent authority is the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. Example: Sanctions are imposed on a Finnish citizen, person X, in an EU sanctions regulation binding on Finland. Person X has a housing loan, amortised by monthly instalments to the bank. Person X also has home insurance, which is payable on a quarterly basis, and an investment policy paid on a monthly basis. Furthermore, X receives an employee pension. The abovementioned EU sanctions regulation enables the national competent authority to grant permission to unfreeze certain frozen funds or other economic resources or to make certain funds or economic resources available. The precondition is that the funds or economic resources are necessary to satisfy the basic needs of the sanctioned party. Basic needs include, among other things, payments for foodstuffs, rent or mortgage, medicines and medical treatment, taxes, insurance premiums, and public utility charges. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs has, at person X's application, granted person X a derogation to satisfy basic needs, which covers housing loan instalments and home insurance premiums. Before the bank takes receipt of a housing loan instalment, it checks the contents of the derogation presented by person X and saves it in customer's KYC-file. The insurance company also acts accordingly and accepts the home insurance premiums. In contrast, the investment insurance policy is excluded from the scope of the derogation, and the insurance company does not accept related payments. The employee pension company seeks a derogation from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs for the payment of employee pension. In connection with the payment of the pension, the employee pension company may also need to provide the derogation to its own bank so that the bank can ascertain that the funds may be transferred to the recipient of pension despite person X being subject to EU sanctions.

                        "(17) The supervised entity must use a justified realistic return expectation based on the allo- cation of investments offered to the saver. The realistic return expectation in an insur- ance or savings component with guaranteed return is the combined amount of the guaranteed return and the assumed annual customer bonuses. The mortality bonus of insurance must be taken into account as return.",
                        "(18) In an illustration for guaranteed-return insurance policy, the guaranteed interest rate under the agreement must be used instead of the zero-return assumption as the ex- pected return when the investment plan has been formulated so as to allocate all insur- ance premiums to the guaranteed-return part.",

                        "(24) The illustration must be made so that the savings instalments or insurance premiums are constant throughout the payment period if the agreement concerns regular savings instalments.

                        "(26) An illustration under these regulations and guidelines must indicate that it is an illustra- tion compliant with FIN-FSA regulations and guidelines. The calculation must state that it is not a promise of future returns or capital accumulation, nor a binding disclosure of the expenses to be charged but rather it has been complied to facilitate the assessment and comparison of the agreements available. The calculation must also state that the figures presented may only realise provided that the instalment and investment plans assumed in the calculation are followed, the return estimates realise and the expenses charged on the agreement and the investments do not change during the agreement period.",
                        "(27) An illustration as referred to in these regulations and guidelines must be provided to the saver as an integrated whole so that the saver can distinguish it from the rest of the ma- terial. The calculation may not be presented or submitted in a manner that may lead the saver to consider the information contained in it is less important than other information provided on the agreement."

If the offeror has particular grounds to assume that the proposed arrangement will not be supported by a sufficient number of shareholders in a General Meeting, before the publication of the takeover bid - bearing in mind the provisions on the use of inside information - the offeror should also consider the position held by such shareholders whose consent is de facto needed to make decisions in a General Meeting of shareholders, regarding the anticipated takeover bid."

Legal actions, whereby the holding or voting rights attached to the shares offered to be sold in the takeover bid are transferred to the offeror in accordance with the terms of the takeover bid (completion of the takeover bid), may not be taken before at least three weeks have elapsed from the time allowed for acceptance of the takeover bid. The time allowed for the acceptance of a takeover bid may not be less than three nor more than ten weeks. The time allowed for the acceptance of a takeover bid may, for a special reason, be more than ten weeks provided that the business operations of the offeree company are not hindered for longer than is reasonable. A notice of the closing of the takeover bid shall be given at least two weeks prior to the closure of the bid. GUIDELINE (paragraphs 28-32)",

In this case, the procedure for extension or suspension of the offer period shall be described in the terms of the offer.",
                        "(29) According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, the decision to extend the offer period shall be made and disclosed within the original offer period. If the fulfilment of a condition under the terms of the offer concerning the proportion of ownership or voting rights so requires, a decision on extension of the offer period may, however, be made and disclosed at the latest on the following day after the lapsing of the offer period.",
                        "(30) According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, the offer period may be extended either so that the offer period continues until further notice or so that it ends on a specified date, at least two weeks after the announcement of the extension of the offer period. If the validity of the bid is extended until further notice, information on the closing of the bid shall be disclosed in accordance with chapter 11, section 12, subsection 2 of the SMA, with at least two weeks' notice.",
                        "(31) According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, a specific reason to extend the offer period beyond ten weeks could be, for example, that there are particular hindrances to the implementation of the bid. If, for example, the implementation of the bid requires the permission of a competition authority, the offeror shall extend the offer period until the authority has processed the matter and the offeror has had the possibility to assess the impact of the conditions, if any, included in the permission of the competition authority, on the bid.",
                        "(32) According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, in a conditional takeover bid, the offeror may, according to international practice, extend the validity of the bid after the conditions of the offer have been fulfilled and the offer has turned unconditional and the first transactions to complete the bid have been made or the offeror has confirmed it will make them. In particular, this practice may improve retail investors' opportunities to react to the situation. The unconditionality of the bid may in this case constitute a reason of such a nature that it authorises the offeror to extend the offer period beyond ten weeks.

                        "(33) In accordance with chapter 11, section 12, subsection 3 of the SMA, FIN-FSA may, upon an application by the offeree company and, where necessary, without hearing the offeror, order that the time allowed for the acceptance of the takeover bid and the restriction set for the completion of the takeover bid, referred to in chapter 11, section 12, subsection 1 of the SMA, be extended so that the offeree company can convene the General Meeting of the Shareholders to consider the bid. Due to an extension, the offeror shall have the right to waive the bid within five banking days from being informed of the decision of the Financial Supervisory Authority. GUIDELINE (paragraphs 34-38)",
                        "(34) According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, the FIN-FSA decision on extension of the offer period may be appropriate, for example, where there is insufficient time otherwise to convene a General Meeting of the shareholders of the offeree company during the offer period to discuss the takeover bid. Correspondingly, a decision on extension of the offer period may be appropriate when it is justifiable to convene a General Meeting of the shareholders during the offer period due to issues arising during the offer period. Such issues may include, for example, a competing bid or a bid on an individual business function of the offeree company.",
                        "(35) Pursuant to the Companies Act, the management of the offeree company has the obligation to act with due care and promote the interests of the company. Therefore, FIN- FSA, as a rule, gives a decision to extend the offer period, where a General Meeting of the shareholders has been convened by an initiative of the Board of Directors or the Supervisory Council. In situations where the shareholders of the offeree company have required a convening of a General Meeting of the shareholders, FIN-FSA pays particular attention in its deliberations on the matters to be decided on by the General Meeting.",
                        "(36) FIN-FSA recommends that the offeree company applies for a decision on the extension of the offer period without undue delay. The application shall describe the matters to be addressed by the General Meeting of the shareholders.",
                        "(37) If the offeror does not waive the takeover bid, the decision on extension of the offer period shall be binding on the offeror, pursuant to chapter 11, section 12, subsection 3.",
                        "(38) According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, information on a decision to extend the offer period or to waive the bid shall be disclosed and communicated in a similar manner to a decision on a takeover bid."

GUIDELINE (paragraph 16)",
                        "(16) According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, the obligation to launch a bid generally falls on the party with the largest interest in exercising control in the offeree company. However, in its decision on the party obliged to launch a bid, FIN-FSA may also take into account an agreement among the parties obliged to launch a bid provided that the agreed party obliged to launch a bid has the financial capabilities to fulfil the obligation to launch a bid."

                        "(18) In accordance with chapter 11, section 31 of the SMA, FIN-FSA may issue further regulations on the grounds for granting the exemptions, referred to in chapter 11, section 26 of the SMA. These regulations are presented in paragraphs 19-23, below. REGULATION (paragraphs 19-22)",
                        "(19) The consideration for granting an exemption is based on an overall assessment. The assessment takes into account, for example, the general principles laid down in chapters 1 and 11 of the SMA, the general principles of Article 3 of the Takeover Bids Directive as well as the impact of the exemption on the effective position of minority shareholders FINANSSIVALVONTA FINANSINSPEKTIONEN FINANCIAL SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY Issued 10.6.2013 Valid from 1.7.2013 until further notice 9/2013 Takeover bid and the obligation to launch a bid 29 (42) Whether the minority shareholders of the offeree company have been aware of the arrangement in advance and been able to influence its content are also taken into account, when considering an exemption.",
                        "(20) Particular reasons for granting an exemption from the obligation to launch a bid could include at least one of the following: a) The proportion of voting rights exceeding the threshold for an obligation to launch a bid is not effectively transferred, for example, when transferring holdings to an entity or foundation within the same sphere of control. b) The proportion of voting rights exceeding the threshold for an obligation to launch a bid is transferred through an inheritance, as referred to in chapter 1, section 1 of the Inheritance Code, or in another manner to the persons referred to in chapter 2 of the Inheritance Code (succession). c) The proportion of voting rights exceeding the threshold for an obligation to launch a bid is exceeded on the basis of a share issue based on preferential rights of the shareholders, where the other shareholders have not used their preferential subscription right in full. d) The proportion of voting rights exceeding the threshold for an obligation to launch a bid is exceeded in a corporate transaction where the consideration comprises shares in the offeree company. e) The proportion of voting rights exceeding the threshold for an obligation to launch a bid is exceeded due to an underwriting commitment related to a share issue. f) The proportion of voting rights exceeding the threshold for an obligation to launch a bid is exceeded by an arrangement whose purpose is to secure the continuity of an offeree company in financial difficulty.",
                        "(21) Unless the position of minority shareholders has been secured sufficiently by way of other measures, an exemption from the obligation to launch a bid under section 20, subsections d-f above is contingent upon a decision on the arrangement by a General Meeting of the shareholders of the offeree company. In this case, the offeree company must disclose sufficient information on the anticipated arrangement before the General Meeting of the shareholders. In the General Meeting of the shareholders deciding on the arrangement, shareholders of the offeree company, who are independent of the arrangement, must support the arrangement by a majority of at least two thirds of the votes cast.",
                        "(22) A particular reason for an exemption from the obligation to launch a bid may also be that the mandatory bid threshold is exceeded in a situation where mutually independent shareholders begin to act in concert in order to exercise control in the offeree company. In this situation, FIN-FSA pays special attention, in its consideration, to granting an exemption on the mutual independence of the shareholders acting in concert and to considering whether the shareholders acting in concert had increased their proportion of voting rights before they began to act in concert. GUIDELINE (paragraphs 23-25)",
                        "(23) An exemption may be granted permanently or for a fixed period. When an exemption is granted for a fixed period, the party receiving the exemption must reduce its holdings within a specified period under the bid threshold or, if the circumstances have changed FINANSSIVALVONTA FINANSINSPEKTIONEN FINANCIAL SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY Issued 10.6.2013 Valid from 1.7.2013 until further notice 9/2013 Takeover bid and the obligation to launch a bid 30 (42) materially, apply for a new exemption. Conditions may also be set for an exemption. Such a term could be, for example, that the recipient of the exemption may not increase its proportion of voting rights in the offeree company.",
                        "(24) An exemption may be applied for before exceeding the bid threshold, on the condition that anticipated arrangement is implemented. An application for an exemption, and a decision on it, are in these cases secret, pursuant to the Act on the openness of government activities, until the anticipated arrangement has been disclosed. However, according to FIN-FSA's interpretation, if an exemption is applied for only after exceeding the proportion of voting rights triggering the obligation to launch a bid, the arising of the bid obligation must be disclosed in accordance with chapter 11, section 22 of the SMA. According to FIN-FSA's interpretation, in this case, an exemption must be applied for without delay after the arising of the obligation to launch a bid.",
                        "(25) Unless secrecy provisions require otherwise, FIN-FSA will publish any exemptions from the obligation to launch a bid on its website. Where an exemption has been applied for on condition of the implementation of an anticipated arrangement, the exemption shall be disclosed only after the anticipated arrangement has been disclosed."

                        "(20) In assessing the justifications to derogate downwards from the starting point for the determination of an equitable price, FIN-FSA takes into account, among other things, the following: · the time of previous securities purchases, the size of individual purchases and the proportion of the consideration paid to the market price of the security prevailing at the time of purchase · the position of the Board of Directors of the offeree company regarding derogating from the minimum consideration · whether the securities acquired at a higher price have been acquired from the management of the offeror or the offeree company or other parties closely related with the offeror or the offeree company · the total number of shares purchased during the six months preceding the arising of the obligation to launch a bid."
